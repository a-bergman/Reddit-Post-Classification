cbmrz3,chuy1530,cooking,Weekly menusetting has changed my life Ive always enjoyed cooking but in the past struggled constantly with what to cook I would get home after work and honestly the stress of having to decide what my wife or I would be cooking that night led to us just grabbing fast food a lot of the time Grocery shopping was a crapshoot and a lot of food ended up getting thrown away without getting cooked because well Ill make SOMETHING with chicken this week just didnt always pan outSo about  months ago my wife brought home a menu board shed printed out and framed link below since she was as frustrated with it as I was At first I thought it was kind of overkill but after a couple weeks I completely bought in We sat down and made a list of every dish we can cook by category roastsstews Chicken etc and every Sunday we pull out the list and go through and pick a dish for each day then go shopping based on that We even consolidated the recipes for everything we use recipes for in one place and basically have our own little cook book on the computer We also program in leftovers which has reduced those going to waste as wellMaybe this is something most of you already do but growing up my family always played it by ear so this level of planning had never occurred to me We are eating better cheaper food than before with more variety and the stress of deciding what to make is way reduced We dont stick  to the menu sometimes days get flipped around or something comes up and we do have to grab take out but it happens way way less than before we had a plan Its great and I suggest everybody that is having trouble with what to cook give it a shot MenuhttpsimgurcomaRPRbjU,1

caxfus,CougarAries,cooking,LPT Your stoves Medium setting is NOT a temperature its how fast your pan will heat up and every stoves medium is different Use a IR thermometer instead I get irked when recipes say to heat your pan on MediumHigh heat  Its relatively useless because it doesnt explain what the temperature you need to get your pan to and maintain it which is what you use the dials forAnd every stove on the market is different There is no standard of what HighMediumLow means  Even the different burners of your stovehob are different  The big burners low could possibly put out as much heat as the little burners highGet an infrared thermometer and start learning what temperatures your pan should be at for different styles of cooking and where the hot spots are Then use the dials to get it to that temp Searing  Get it at least F  Grilled cheese or pancakes  F is just about right Scrambled eggs F For general cooking I keep it at The only real benefits of the different dial settings are that a lower heat can more evenly heat a pan creating less hot spots and can be easier to prevent overheating since it takes longer to overheat  But at the same time I see way too many novice cooks using a much too cold pan to cook with If youre supposed to be browning meat and instead its simmering in a pool of meat juice your pan is way too cold,1

c9so00,mthmchris,cooking,Recipes How to fry almost any tofu dish in the Chinese style Today I wanted to teach you how to prepare and cook tofu in the Chinese style Thats an impossibly vast space to cover so to make it all actually possible to tackle lets focus on  the most common tofu varieties and  predominantly oil based cooking methods The techniques well go over arePanfrystirfry Probably the most commonly seen oilbased tofu fry technique The tofu is panfried until crisp and then tossed with sauce and aromatics To illustrate this well use a basic soy sauce fried tofuPanfrysimmer Another oftused approach Well be showing this technique using an oldschool shrimp and tofu dish that we adapted from an old Qing dynasty cookbook Strictly panfry This is a less commonly seen approach that Im hesitant to list out as its own category as its predominantly only seen with one classic Chinese street food dish Tieban Tofu That said of all these techniques its the one thatd be most applicable to Western cooking so I think its nice one to coverStrictly Deepfry Theres a crazy number of deepfried tofu dishes in China but to illustrate well go over my personal favorite deep fried tofu dish the Teochew dish Puning TofuDeepfryStirfrySimmer Show with Sichuanese Jiachang Homestyle tofu Note that often panfrying and deepfrying can be interchangeably used with this method especially at home Theres a video to go along with thishttpsyoutubevWIenKp  in it you can see the last three techniques in action For the first two techniques Ill be referring to an older video we made  Fried tofu two wayshttpsyoutubeZjOGchNWMTofu varietiesSo where in gods name to even begin here Theres so many damn tofu products ranging from deepfried tofu puffs to smoked tofu to puddinglike Douhua So lets zero in on the stuff that would be commonly referred to as just TofuIn the West if you go to a supermarket that sells tofu youll probably run into two types of tofu regular and silken The regular tofu then ranges in firmness from Soft to ExtraFirm while the Silken tofull come in three sorts Soft Firm and ExtraFirm Regular tofu is made using Nigari Magnesium chloride as the coagulant If youre curious the general approach of how to make it I talked about it a bit in the homemade Sichuanese Douhua posthttpswwwredditcomrCookingcommentsbqesrrecipesichuanspicytofuricedouhuafanEBEABEAAD Basically to make tofu you follow the general process outlined there then toss the coagulated soymilk in a specific tofu press in place of using the wooden basket To get the varying degrees of firmness the tofu is pressed for a longer or shorter timeSilken tofu is made using Gypsum Calcium Sulfate as the coagulant Silken tofu usually isnt pressed in the same way but varying firmness is achieved by controlling the ratio of soybean to water in the mixSo right Heres the thing that was a bit of a mindfuck for me when I first came to China  theres not really the same softmediumfirm categorization that exists in the West I mean there is soft of allow me to explainFirst off the names and dominant styles of tofu are extremely regional in China Im going to explain the common tofu types but know that these are  the workhorse tofus in the city I live Shenzhen and  how theyre referred to at my local market I cant guarantee itd be the same if you went to a market in say Shanghai That said Shenzhens a migrant city with folks all around the country so I think its still pretty indicative of the country at largeShigao Tofu  Shigao Tofu is made using gypsum as the coagulant  the Western counterpart would be firm silken tofu Its pretty delicate  usually used in soups or stews The dominant tofu in Cantonese cuisineYanshui Tofu  Yansui tofu is made using nigari as the coagulant  It usually ends up a bit firmer than the Shigao tofu  its the sort thats in your Mapo Tofu Depending on where you are in China it can also be referred to as Lushui tofu or Hakka tofu Im sure theres way more names In the West this would correspond with soft tofu though in recipes that use it you could also use medium tofuLao Tofu  Lao Tofu starts out at Yanshui tofu ie a nigari tofu buts then pressed for longer Its the dominant tofu style in the North of China Generally speaking we like to use Shigao tofu ie firm silken with waterbased cooking methods Yanshui tofu ie soft deepfrying and Lao Tofu ie firm panfrying Lots of exceptions there but thats usually our approachHow to cut tofuTofus pretty simple to cut A few of the most common cutsSheets Slice the tofu in half lengthwise and then cut in into  cm pieces working perpendicular from that cutCubes Slice your tofu in half lengthwise Then slice down to get one inch strips and finally cut in the other direction to get one inch cubesTriangles Slice your tofu in half crosswise Cut each crosswise piece in half at a  degree bias Flip each piece up and cut each into  pieces about cm each How to Prep Tofu for fryingDontThats a bit of a strong statement but Ive just gotta get something off my chest real quick I see a lot of sources online  sources I love places like Serious Eats and BA recommend you buy firm tofu and then press it further before you cook it I see this advice everywhere from AskCulinary to Buzzfeed Tasty videos  its feels like its starting to become gospel Ive also never seen anyone in China press their tofu at home Ever Thats the fucking point of firm tofu  its pressed Ive gotten into arguments on this very topic and the common response is that well in the West we just like it firmer and meatier And I mean if you just like it firmer than firm Im certainly not going to stop you Weve all got preferences I like overcooked root vegetables my parents like their steaks well done But what Id argue against is the meatier claim When we cook meat we go to great pains to make it as juicy as possible  brine marinade deep fry pass through oil whatever So why when people in the West cook tofu do they go to such lengths to remove almost every bit of moisture they possibly can You wouldnt be mimicking meat youd be at best mimicking overcooked meat And I mean really tofus not the best mock meat anyhow  that crown likely belongs to Seitan ie wheat glutenI can think of one and only one situation where itd make sense to press tofu at home  I know in some supermarkets in the states a nondescript box of Medium tofus all you can find If you have medium tofu and you want to morph it into firm tofu totally Press it yourself good idea Otherwise I dunno Feels superfluous at bestFurther many people advocate coating tofu in cornstarch before frying it While it wouldnt really hurt too much and Im sure theres some coated tofu dishes out there that Im not thinking of tofu generally doesnt need cornstarch tofu needs patience Its one of the cool things about frying tofu  the outside tends to get nice and crispA note on poaching tofu cubes in warm salt waterOk so I said dont prep tofu There is one thing you can do if you feel so lead If youre using soft Yanshui tofu in something saucy you can poach the tofu in hot salty water for  minutes then leave it in there until its ready to use Yanshui tofu can sort of have a slight grassy undertone that you might not want to flavor your sauce with The poach will help dampen that taste as well as help form the tofu piecesMethod  Panfry then StirfryHigh level overview here Cut firm tofu into  cm pieces or triangles gt Panfry on medium heat for  minutes until the bottom is evenly golden brown gt Flip fry for  minutes gt Remove the tofu gt Fry aromatics gt Add back the tofu gt Add seasoning eg wine soy sauce salt sugar MSG etcIngredients Soy Sauce Fried TofuFirm Tofu  One block g Cut in half and then into one cm pieces Green onion  about three sprigs separated into the white part to use as an aromatic and the green part to finish the dish Cut these into about two inch sectionsShallot   Sliced If youre somewhere where you can only get those tiny little shallots use Liaojiu   tbsp Aka Shaoxing wine Huangjiu Chinese cooking wineLight Soy Sauce   tbspSugar  tspOil  tbsp For frying Quick note that this amount   tbsp  is if youre using a round bottomed wok If using a flat bottomed wok or some other piece of kitchen cookware add enough oil to get about  cm up from the bottom of the wokProcess Soy Sauce fried tofu Cut the tofu and aromatics and thoroughly dry the tofu When working with firm tofu theres a small tough bit on the very top and bottom of the tofu  This is totally optional but we slice that off in order to get a more even texture from the tofu  Slice the tofu in half lengthwise and then cut in into  cm pieces working from the other direction  Thoroughly pat the tofu dry with some paper towels  we dont want the tofu to be popping like crazy when we add it to the oil to fry  Chop up the aromatics  slicing the green onion into two inch pieces and separating the white part from the green part  Thinly slice up the shallot and toss it together with the white part of the green onion Longyau then with the heat on medium carefully add the tofu into the wok As always first longyau  get that wok piping hot shut off the heat add in the oil and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface  With the heat on medium add in the tofu pieces  If youre a pro you can carefully slide them all in at once but to make sure that the tofu doesnt pile and break worst case scenario when making this dish we recommend adding the pieces one by one Let the tofu panfry for five to eight minutes until the bottom is nice and golden brown Same deal as whenever youre panfrying anything from any cuisine ever  dont touch the tofu  Let the tofu develop a crust and get nice and golden brown  If you got a round bottom wok like us though youre gunna want to tilt the wok to each side to move the oil and ensure the tofu cooks evenly Flip the tofu and cook on the other side for five minutes  Take out the tofu once each side is crispy and golden brown Find a tiny plate or something to put your tofu on thisll be out for like three minutes tops In the same oil same medium heat fry the white part of the green onion and the shallot for  minutes then add back the tofu  Just fry until they start to smell real nice then add back the tofu  Give it a quick mix together  seconds Up the heat to high then add the liaojiu over the spatula and around the sides of the wok and give it a quick mix Then do the same thing with the soy sauce Adding these liquids on the spatula and over the sides of the wokll help ensure that they sizzle and quickly reduce instead of collect at the bottom and start simmering  After each addition of liquid give it about a  second mix  Make sure theres no visible liaojiu in the wok before you add in the soy sauce     Add the sugar fry together until the sugar dissolves  seconds  Add the green part of the green onion shut off the heat give it a quick mix and outMethod  Panfry then SimmerHigh level overview here Cut firm tofu into  cm pieces or triangles gt Fry on medium heat for  minutes until bottom is evenly golden brown gt Flip fry for five minutes more gt Add liquid gt Cover simmer for  minutes gt Season gt Simmer allowing liquid to  absorb into the tofu  minutesIngredients Fried Tofu braised with Shrimp  Firm Tofu  one block g Same deal Cut in half then into one cm pieces   Dried shrimp  g to be simmered in two cups water Natures MSG  Oil or Lard   tbsp  For frying  Lard is a great frying oil for tofu Rice wine   cup So classically this specific dish would be simmered in a specific sweet kind of Shaoxing wine But heres the thing  in the West the vast majority of stuff thats labelled Shaoxing is salted Alcohols laws are fun So just grab a nicer sort of rice wine  something like a Japanese sake would work great dont waste an expensive one though Light soy sauce   tbsp To be added near the end of cooking Sugar  tsp Added together with the soy sauce Green onion  green part only  sprigs Cut into two inch sectionsProcess Fried tofu braised with shrimpSo Im putting braised in quotes because using the English terminology braise doesnt really make a hell of a lot of sense with tofu  Its just sorta the goto translation for the Chinese word men simmering in sauce and theres enough similarities that you could kinda think of it in that wayRinse the dried shrimp to get the dust off then simmer in two cups water  covered  for one hour  This is the first time Ive personally seen this method and holy hell I was just blown away by the end result  Those Qing dynasty cooks knew their shit  The end result of this stuff after an hour long simmer is basically just concentrated umami juice The first time I tasted this dish I just couldnt believe that there was no MSG added in here its that rich in glutamateCut and fry the tofu in accordance to steps  above With the obvious exception of cutting up the whitepartofthegreenonion and slicing the shallots  This dishll only have some green onion sections that we toss in near the endOnce the tofu is nice and golden brown on both sides add in the shrimp the shrimp liquid and the rice wine  Cover and braise for  minutes on medium low Thiss gunna  let the raw alcohol bite of the rice wine cook out  infuse the tofu with that delicious shrimp umami liquid  Random note that glutamic acid is water and not alcohol soluble  the rice wine is more for taste and to help bring out the other flavonoids in the dishAfter  minutes add in the soy sauce and sugar Let that continue to cook down on mediumlow for a  minutes flipping the tofu to make sure both sides absorb the sauce So what youre looking for is the liquid to be about  reducedabsorbed into the tofu  This should take  minutes  Add in the soy sauce and sugar making sure the sugar dissolves into the liquid  Let that reduce and absorb into the tofu flipping to make sure both sides get that delicious liquidOnce the sauce is completely absorbed shut off the heat and mix in the green onion The green onion here is mostly for fragrance and color        Method  Strictly PanfryingCut firm tofu into large cm blocks gt Lightly oil a large skillet gt Add tofu turn heat to medium gt Brush a touch of oil on top side gt Smother with way too much spice mix gt Fry for  minutes gt Rearrange if needed fry for  minutes more gt Optionally chop into cubesIngredients Street food style Tieban TofuThis dishs a classic a nightmarkets in China  youll usually see the tofu slowly frying on a flat top smothered in a type of Chinese BBQ spice mix and then chopped into bite sized pieces to serveFirm tofu   blocks g Cut into larger  cm pieces  four slices per block This needs to be thicker because we cant have bubbling oil muffing up and making our spice mix clumpOil For brushing Peanut oil or sunflower oil are niceScallions Sliced for garnishSpice mix  star anise   tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns   tsp cumin seeds   tbsp Perilla seeds  or up the cumin seed by  tsp  tsp white pepper powder   tsp ginger powder   tsp garlic powder   tbsp chili powder   tbsp salt  tbsp MSG   tsp sugar Thesell all get ground together Perilla seeds are also used in Korean cuisine so you might be able to try your luck there For the chili powder youll want one thats not overly fiery so the bog standard cayenne pepper from the bottle should work greatThat spice mix aboves one of the classic spice mixes used in Chinese BBQ Just add in a bit of anticaking agents and youve basically got what the street vendors useProcess  Street food style Tieban TofuGrind together the spice powder First grind together the star anise Sichuan peppercorns and cumin seeds Then add everything except the saltsugarMSG and grind again Finally add the saltsugarMSG and give it a final grind The reason the saltsugarMSG is added at the end is so that it doesnt cakeBrush the widest skillet you have with a thin layer of oil Less oil for this one because any oil bubbling over the topll muff up the layer of spice  thiss kinda mimicking Chinese BBQ dishes hereAdd the tofu to the pan brush on a top layer of oil and smother with the spice mix I know smother isnt really a proper amount but just use your own judgement Take a look at a picture of how much we addedhttpsiimgurcomdfkEUjpg if you need Fry the tofu for  minutes then rearrange if needed The street food vendors use a flat top so they can cook these nice and even For us on a stove rearranging halfway throughs a nice ideaFry for  minutes more and with a minute to go top with sliced scallionsOptionally chop into  cm cubes Thiss the way theyll often do it on the street then toss it in a bit of a plastic cup then eat with disposable chopsticksMethod  Strictly DeepFryingWith deepfrying it can often be nice to use a softer tofu The outside of the tofull form a nice crust while the moisture on the inside will evaporate and cause the tofu to puff upNote that this is not how they make tofu puffs  tofu puffs are made using a very firm mix of  beans to water but then including agents like ammonium carbonate borax and baking soda in the soy milk blend However if you search online in Chinese for DIY tofu puffs theyll often erroneously IMHO use deep fried soft tofu as a base High level overviewCut tofu into  cm triangles gt Add to oil at C over max flame gt Temp should lower to C gt Allow tofu to form and float gt Break apart any stuck pieces gt Lower flame to mediumlow fry at C for eight minutes Ingredients Puning TofuOk so this specific dish Puning tofu traditionally uses its own special tofu product here also called Puning tofu What Puning tofu is is a soft nigari tofu where the soy milk has some sweet potato starch mixed in then the tofu pieces are individually pressed and cut in half before fryingYou know how I just said that soft tofu puffs up really nice when deepfrying Yeah it also loves to collapse after In an average batch of deepfried tofu youll likely have  collapse on you its fine still tasty but way less easy on the eyes The starch in Puning tofu meanwhile allows it to maintain that puffy appearance Where I live in Shenzhen sometimes we see restaurants make this exact sub  soft tofu for Puning tofu  if they have sourcing problems with the latter as a city with a bunch of Teochew migrants the Puning tofu usually runs out at our local market by am Still works So if you happen to find Puning tofu use that otherwise dont hesitate to reach for soft Puning tofu or soft tofu g Oil  cups For frying Peanuts nice Two cups is if you use a round bottomed wok for deep frying Heavily recommended youll need way less oil in a wok If using a Dutch oven use like the  gallons of oil or whatever you need to actually fill that up proper s if it needed to be saidFor the sauce g Chinese chives   tsp salt optional  tsp fish sauce   cup water Fish sauce is a thing in Teochew dipping sauces I swearProcess Puning TofuCut the tofu into triangles If actually using Puning tofu just cut those little blocks in halfIn a wok heat the oil up until C then drop in the tofu slices For best results Id suggest no more than ten slices at a time else you could start to flirt with crowdingContinue over max flame until the tofu slices begin to float  minutes Once you drop the tofu slices in itll likely lower the temperature to C Thats fine The tofull also start to stick slightly also totally normal just let it form and gently break them apart with chopsticks Lower the flame to mediumlow fry for  minutes at C Or until puffy golden brown and the exterior begins to slightly break down Flip periodicallyRemove the tofu pieces lay on a papertowel lined plateTo make the sauce mince the jiucai toss in a bowl Add the salt and mix it into the Jiucai Then add the fish sauce and do the same Then add the waterMethod  Deep Fry then Stir Fry then SimmerNote again that you can either deep fry or pan fry your tofu here If panfrying choose firm tofu If deepfrying choose soft tofuBasic high level overviewPanfry according to method  or deepfry

c7y0zo,VinPeppBBQ,cooking,What went wrong with my chorizo burgers I made Mexican chorizo for the first time last week I used a pork butt that I ground and a recipe I got from a coworker The flavor was spot on but the burgers were falling apart on the grill and really the only thing that held them together on the spatula was the thick slice of cheese I melted on top Below are a few thoughts I had and Im curious if any single one is the culprit or a combinationThe recipe I used had a spice blend mixed in the meat and some white vinegar And it further stated to let it sit in the fridge overnight before cooking with it The next day as you can imagine there was a lot of liquid in the bowl with the meat obviously the vinegar and juices pulled out of the meat from the seasoning I mixed these juices back into the meat which resulted in a very wet mix Should I have discarded the juices instead of mixing back into the meatOris it just hard to make chorizo burgers with just chorizo Should I have mixed some beef in the burgers as a binder of sorts Along with this point while the burgers tasted phenomenal they were a little too rich if that makes sense It was tough to finish an entire burger Could this also be mitigated by working in some ground beefI love chorizo and now that I know how to make it I foresee making it a lot in the future but Id like to redeem these burgers Thoughts,1

c6jku3,theycallmeMrPickles,cooking,Stir Fry  avoiding burning  smoking brown sugar This is a really basic question but I havent been able to figure out the solution to it yet  when youre making a stir fry with brown sugar in the marinade how do you avoid smoking yourself out of the house The last two times I made stir fry and marinaded the chicken in a sauce that contained brown sugar the minute it hit the pan it turned my kitchen into a smokehouse forcing me to open all the windows and have a fan blowing outside The only solution Ive found is to cook the chicken on a lower temperature but then it pretty much just turns into steaming the chicken unless I constantly drain the liquid from the pan Ive tried a variety of sauces thinking that the brown sugar may be too much but even as little as  tsp to  cup liquid causes this Any less then that and I cant taste it anymore so I leave it outEdit  thanks all for your advice Im going to skip the marinade next time and just watch some basic stirfry videos to get a refresher of the basics of stirfry Im also going to try to use a deeper pan with more oil as Im thinking the lack of enough oil is also causing a secondary issue that Im having with some of the fond burning early,1

czz7xx,mthmchris,cooking,Recipe The Original Hot amp Sour Soup Wuxistyle  So today I wanted to show you how to make Hot and Sour soup Its a dish thats graced takeout menus around the world so perhaps surprisingly its something thats not overly common in mainland China itself Key word Mainland Theres a lively tradition of hot and sour soup in Taiwan whichs likely how the dish traveled to the West That Taiwanese soup in turn probably culinary history is never cut and dry came from the town of Wuxi in the Jiangsu province where its a muchloved local snack So while that  the Wuxi type  is the version Ill show you how to make before we get into it I do want to emphasize that theres a lot of different hot and sour soups out there in China While the dishs popular only in small pockets of the country its an old dish Like at least dating back to the Song dynasty old While I often like to wax poetic about how  of all dishes were developed between the late th and early th century this is definitely one of that  While the sources disagree and Im suspiciously not a historian and so not exactly the best at judging these things it likely came from an even older dish from the Henan province called Hula tang pepper soup And yet there seems to be a Shandong variant thats almost as old which then spread through the north and particularly the Northwest into Shaanxi which has its own style of Hot amp Sour It all gets increasingly murky the further back you get so Ill stop rambling This soup tastes real good Cook it Video is here if youd like a visual to follow alonghttpsyoutubePtscLqGfkQ Ingredients  Beef shank  g For making a beef broth Theres some evidence that this soup was first developed by the Muslim community in Wuxi thus the beef but Ill stop with the history lesson  Ingredients for the beef broth  star anise   tsp Sichuan peppercorn   tsp white peppercorn   inch knob of ginger one big sprig scallion tied in a knot  tbsp liaojiu aka Shaoxing wine  Uh I guess the original Muslim version wouldnt have the wine though   Dried Day Lilies  g Soaked in cool water for  hours Now were about to embark on a journey of like a million different additions to this soup Of all of them Id say only this  the dried day lilies  and the next ingredient dried shiitake mushrooms are mandatory Everything else if you can get them great If not dont sweat it use what you can A few other ideas on what you can toss inll be in the notes below  Dried Shiitake Mushrooms  g Soaking in cool water for  hours Both this and the dried day lilies should be readily available at Chinese supermarkets abroad  Muer Wood Ear Mushrooms  g Soaked in cool water for  hours  Sweet potato noodles  g Cut into a manageable size then soaked in cool water for  hours  Silken tofu  g The firmer sort sometimes Douhua  ie tofu pudding  is also translated as silken tofu You could also sub in notsilken soft tofu too ie the sort you use to make Mapo Tofu If using regular tofu first cut into thicker sheets quickly blanch the tofu for  minutes in salted water then cut into strips  Qianzhang aka Soy Tofu Sheets g One sheet  Seasoning for the soup  tsp dark soy sauce   tsp light soy sauce   tsp salt  tsp sugar In the accompanying video we did an individual serving so all of these are four times what we showed there This is the amount to accompany L of beef broth  Slurry of  cup water or the soaking liquid from the dried shiitake mushrooms mixed with  tbsp of potato starch  preferably or cornstarch in a pinch Ok Quick aside on starches in Chinese cooking I know I use cornstarch quite a bit in these recipes I use cornstarch because  its extremely common in China and used by many homecooks and  it has the benefit of being able to be sourced abroad Generally though chefs tend to reach more for potato starch tapioca starch or cassava starch Why Those starches tend to thicken slightly faster helpful in a fast stirfry and they also seem to be a bit more stable in this kind of thicker soup Its all kind of subtle though usually the starches are interchangeable but here wed be more comfortable recommending you using one of those other starches if you can possibly help it Im sure cornstarch would still do the job though  Seasoning to finish the soup  tsp white pepper powder mixed with  cup Chinkiang vinegar  Two primary types of dark Chinese vinegar  Shaanxi Mature Vinegar  and ZhengjiangChinkiang former is pinyin latter WadeGiles Fragrant Vinegar  Theyre close enough in taste that they can generally be subs for eachother in dishes that arent very vinegar forward but this is a vinegar forward dish Use ZhenjiangChinkiang vinegar if you can possibly help it  Fried Gluten Balls  So I was actually concerned that this might be one of those tough to source ingredients in the West but some people on YT were saying that they could find them at their local Asian supermarket Awesome Amount is basically to your liking just tear into pieces and sprinkle on each bowl of soup near the end  Chopped cilantro To be sprinkled on each bowl of soup  Toasted sesame oil   tsp To be sprinkled on each bowl of soup near the end Notice the lack of chili here  like the Henan Hulatang that the dish likely was derived from the hot actually refers to that sort of white pepper zing That said often this soup can be found served with a side of chili oil just in case you want it like actually spicy hot While Im a sucker for spicy food I personally quite prefer it without chili oil What I would suggest is to try a bowl of it without and mix in a touch of Laoganma chili crisp in at the end or in a separate bowl See how you like it If you enjoy it then for sure make some chili oil to go along with this This soup is generally served alongside a plate of either potstickers or fried baozi Serves four Process  Soak the beef shank for one hour in cool water This draws out a bit of the myoglobin and helps make a cleaner tasting broth  Add the beef the seasoning for the broth and enough water to cover the beef to a pot Cover get up to a boil  Turn the heat to the lowest heat your stovell go and simmer covered for  hours Or until the broth is flavorful and the beef shank is tender enough to poke through with a pair of chopsticks  Soak the sweet potato noodles the dried day lily the shiitake mushroom and the muer in cool water for  hours Or until the broths done cooking Feel free to slice the sweet potato noodles smaller if need be well further chop them down later Optionally save the soaking liquid from the dried shiitake mushrooms for your slurry  give it a quick strain if thats the case  Strain the stock shred the beef Shred by chopping the beef into pieces then shred with the flat of the knife Or alternatively just use the western fork shredding method just dont go too crazy were not trying to make meat floss or anything  Slice the silken tofu into cm strips then keep the strips in cool water to prevent breaking Slice by first slicing the tofu into half centimeter sheets then in the other directions to get half centimeter slivers Toss them in a bowl with cool water to prevent them from breaking up  Prep the qianzhang soy tofu sheets the shiitake mushroom the sweet potato noodles the dried day lilies the cilantro the fried gluten balls and the muer Prep the soy tofu sheets by folding twice hot dog style and once in the other direction then slice down into it to get half cm slivers Prep the shiitake mushroom by squeezing out any excess liquid removing the stem and julienning Chop the sweet potato noodles into  inch pieces Chop the day lilies into  inch pieces Give the cilantro a rough chop tear the fried gluten balls into bite sized pieces Prep the muer by giving them a few chops in each direction  Make the soup So again if youre following along with the video know that we did an individually portioned claypot Mostly because it looks cool Use whatever vessel you want to make this final soup though  Add the shiitake mushrooms the muer wood ear mushrooms the sweet potato noodles the soy tofu sheet and L of the beef broth to a pot Flame on high mediumhigh with claypot  Add the seasoning  the soy sauces the salt the sugar Bring to a boil  Add the silken tofu strips Let it simmer for  seconds  Thicken with the slurry Let it simmer for  seconds or until thickened to your liking cornstarch slurry might need a touch longer to thicken so be patient before thickening further  Mix in the white pepper powdervinegar mixture Make sure the white pepper is good and dissolved in the vinegar Quick mix Heat off  Transfer to serving bowls Top with shredded beef torn fried gluten balls cilantro and the  tsp toasted sesame oil Note on other stuff you can put in Hot and Sour Soup If you notice we didnt put egg drop in this one In Wuxi some hot and sour soup joints add it some dont Were not super crazy about egg drop so we skipped it But I know for some of yall that might be nonnegotiable So for that pot wed use  medium eggs Beat the eggs thoroughly until no stray strands of egg white remain then right after adding in the vinegarwhite pepper shut off the heat Slowly pour the egg in a thin stream into the soup while stirring it in one direction Enoki mushrooms are another common addition Optionally pour some hot boiling water over the mushrooms to give them a sort of lazy mans preblanch and just let them sit there until youre ready to use them You can also use the same technique with the Qianzhang soy tofu sheets too if you like  we simply forgot to do it with this recipe didnt affect the taste much so meh Add the mushrooms in the very beginning along with the shiitake etc Another classic is coagulated duck blood whichs a common addition in the Taiwan version whichs why I kind of feel the Taiwan sort of betrays its Jiangsu origins haha First blanch the blood in boiling water for  seconds then remove and cut into strips like the tofu Might be a nice way to open someones mind about coagulated blood though I supposed theyd first have to be open minded about tofu first Some places use green garlic in place of cilantro We prefer cilantro though,1

cy9bek,nuugat,cooking,Roasted garlic flavour in Indian cooking  Hey there Recently I ate two dishes at an Indian Tamil I suppose restaurant that made me wonder how they managed to create the extra garlicky taste The one was aloo palak and the other was a garlic naan I tried to recreate the garlicky flavour in some other dishes but failed The thing is that it was tasting very roasted but still garlicky However most people advice against actually browning garlic but just frying it briefly as done in some Chinese dishes or Indian Tadka dishes I also found that if you fry it too long the taste gets lost like today when I fried some garlic in ghee which did not turn bitter although it was browned but did not have  a very strong flavour Which is the way to go if you want to have a very strong roasted garlic flavour Any secret tips Common techniques What do you think likely happened to the Garlic Naan at the Indian Restaurant,1

cwzeb7,mthmchris,cooking,Recipe Macao Minchi a Ground Meat Stir Fry  So today I wanted to teach you how to make Macanese Minchi Its one of the most iconic dishes in Macao and really emblematic of Macanese food in generalWhats Macanese food Thats a whole can of worms The food in Macao generally falls into one of three categories  Cantonese theres some great Cantonese food in Macao Portuguese and Macanese  ie the food of the Macanese people The Macanese people meanwhile can sort of be thought of as a mix of Portuguese and Cantonese but that simplification hides a much more convoluted tale I wont pretend to be an expert here  Im certainly no ethnographer  but Id highly recommend wikisurfing the topic if youre so inclined Macanese food meanwhile is fascinating Its a true mix of Western and Cantonese foods  a real mind fuck in the best possible way On the menu Stuff like Diabo  a stew with a bunch of different leftover banquet meats eg Char Siu Siu Yuk Brisket together with tomato potato egg and Cantonese sour pickles Tacho aka Gweilo Buddha Jumps over the Wall  a stew with a similar mix of ingredients plus shrimp paste and Cauliflower African chicken  a milder Piri Piri chicken with an obvious Goan influence Spinach Paste  Westernstyle stewed spinach with garlic and shrimp paste And that shrimp paste Its called Balichao whichs Macaos own slightly Westernstyle take on Cantonesestyle shrimp pasteAnd of course Minchi From everything I can tell word minchi itself seems to be derived from the English work mince although I still havent been able to get a reliable source on the topic But it does communicate the essence of the dish  its stirfried mince meatTheres a mind boggling amount of Minchi variations its one of those dishes where every family seems to have their own way of doing it This version is pretty close to how youd get it if you ate at a Macanese restaurant in Macao  its some marinated minced meat fried with sausage onion and bay leaf served with fried potatoes laid over a bed of white rice and  in that eversoPortugese way  topped with a fried eggVideo is here if youd like a visual to follow alonghttpsyoutubezHwqDBPYIngredientsPork Leg  g and Beef Chuck  g Both  Minced So right Well be handmincing these guys but if you have your own meat grinder feel free to use that too A food processor might end up a touch on the pasty side but would still be an acceptable solution If youve got a real butcher theyll grind it for you too of course Just try not to use the standard supermarket ground beef Why Put simply that stuff is bad It barely makes for an acceptable burger and here we dont have cheese and a whole bunch of fixings to hide the mince under The minces the star of the show here so it should be a proper mince  not the sad discolored shrinkwrapped stuff that you find at most supermarkets in the West  Marinade for the meat  tsp salt  tsp sugar  tbsp white wine   tsp freshly ground black pepper   tsp light soy sauce   tsp dark soy sauce  You can already see the Western influence here By white wine we mean like actual white wine From grapes Its basically the Macanese equivalent of Shaoxing and is used in much the same way Black pepper also makes an appearance black pepper is a very regional thing in China Sausage preferably Portugese Linguia  g Kind of optional bit but this recipe was balanced around including it Feel free to go liberal with the sausage subs here  its what we had to do honestly In the video we used a Harbin sausage  whichs basically a kielbasa It worked it tasted good But a much more authentic sub would likely be a Spanishstyle chorizo or an Italian sausage so you might actually be able to get closer to the proper taste than we did sausage is expensive and tough to source in ShenzhenOptional marinade for the sausage  tsp Cantonese rose wine   tsp sugar Ok so heres the deal  we saw one source in English actually the chef of Fat Rice in Chicago IIRC mention in passing that some Macanese linguia took inspiration from Cantonese Lap Cheong and were seasoned with Cantonese rose wine and were a bit sweeter So on a whim we mixed some sugar and rose wine into the sausage and we really liked what it did for the dish But just know that this might just be us up the creek with no paddle here feel free to skipPotatoes g Russets or something similarly starchy Cut into  cm cubes blanched then friedOnion   MincedGarlic  cloves Minced Some recipes also use shallotsDried bay leaf  g  large leaves Id call this a real hallmark of the dish if only there werent counterexamples of some Macanese families skipping the bay leaf The vast majority of Minchi is fried with bay thoughSeasoning while stirfrying  tbsp white wine   tsp salt  tsp sugar  tsp light soy sauce   tsp black pepper   tbsp rice vinegar Egg  For fryingAlso interestingly olive oil is a really common frying oil in Macanese cooking  basically the Macanese equivalent of peanut oil So if youre used to reaching the olive oil go for it ProcessSuper high level overview here mince your meat then marinate it Fry the mince meat once until dry and crumbly then stirfry everything together Serve with white rice fried potatoes and a sunny side up eggMince the meat If hand mincing first get the beef and pork into a nice fine dice Then just grab a couple cleavers and just start chopping periodically folding the meat over itself to help it break down Unlike something like a dumpling filling were not looking to get it into a paste or anything so if youre quick just  minutes of chopping should be good enough Youre looking for something about this consistencyhttpsiimgurcomszDAopng no matter which mincing route you takeMarinate the minced meat Marinate for  minutesPrep the rest of the ingredients cut the potatoes into  cm cubes mince the onion and garlic finely dice the sausage Marinate the sausage if youre going that route with usBlanch the potato in boiling water for two minutes together with a tablespoon of salt Toss the potato cubes in the salted boiling water and cover Let those cook for two minutes then take them out to drain Dont shock in cool water it can break down the potato cubesOnce dry panfry the potato cubes until golden brown and crispy  minutes over mediumlow heat or deep fry them at C until golden brown I would probably just deep fry these if it were me but I always feel a little bad calling for deepfrying in an ostensibly homey recipe like this So if panfrying over mediumlow flame together with  cup of oil add the potatoes in one evenish layer no need to be overly obsessive with the whole one layer thing and fry periodically stirring them around then rearranging them again into a rough layer Season with a touch of salt lets say start with  tsp and go from there to taste and optionally black pepper ReserveFry the minced meat together with the sausage IF your sausage is uncooked until browned and loose As always first longyau  get your wok piping hot shut off the heat add in the oil  here about one tablespoon  and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface With the flame on medium add in the meat Try your best to break up the minced meat and we like to accomplish that by aggressively chopping at it with a spatula After  minutes the meat should look like thishttpsiimgurcomHalsNespng  loose and cooked Then lower the heat to mediumlow and continue to fry for five minutes until the meat is browned like thishttpsiimgurcomDeeINrpng Stir fry the Minchi As always first longyau  get your wok piping hot shut off the heat add in the oil  here  tablespoon  and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface Heat on medium now Onion in Fry for  minutes until the onion is softened and has changed color   Scooch the onion up the side of the wok then add in a bit more oil   tbsp Add in the garlic Fry garlic for  seconds or until fragrant Add in the dried bay leaves Fry everything together for  seconds Pour the  tbsp white wine over the spatula and around the sides of the wok Quick mix Sausage in Assuming your sausage is a cooked one if you cooked it in step  just add it in with the other meat obviously  second fry Minced meat in  minute fry together Season with the salt sugar black pepper and light soy sauce Brief mix Pour the  tbsp rice vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok Heat off outOk so theres one final step here  frying the egg Reddit formatting really hates when I break up a numbered list soFry the Egg Whatever method you like I like tossing two tbsp of oil or so in a cast iron skillet then heating that up over mediumhigh heat until bubbles form around a pair of chopsticks Crack an egg in let it set shut off the heat Tilt the pan so the oil pools then spoon it over the whites of the egg Once the whites are cooked I pour one spoon of oil over the yolk because I personally like my sunnyside up yolks more gooey then leaking all over the plate though tbh with a bed of rice like this dish I could go either way Season with salt and pepper or whateverAssemble This dish makes six  a rarity in these recipes I know Over a bed of white rice spoon over a bunch of your minchi Make a bit of a ring around everything with the fried potatoes top with your egg As an aside random totally super untraditional thing that I kind of like on the side with this dish some vinegary American or Mexican hot sauce specifically for the potatoes,1

cbknjo,SaturnineSasuke,askculinary,How come people were willing to kill each other in the past over delicious foods Even as far as mere condiments like food spices Was food that terrible back than I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage whenA bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they havent eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp he killed each and every one of themIn addition in the TV version of Naruto which I just finished the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills So an experiment was made in which Ninja Chefs were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out due to the nature of their missions the spec Ops spies etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaignThese two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacherThe first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with they prepared an ambush and killed him stealing the spice Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter And what they did right away was not sell the spices but eat it later that night and kept it adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out a couple resulting in murder because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spicesHell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were fundedIn addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food He even told us this quoteNow I know why the Spartans do not fear deathHe explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eatHell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said So much that they didnt just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didnt need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food It wasnt enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experienceI am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastierCan anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous  In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they havent eaten beef for years to quote Hokuto No KenWhat is the logic behind this Why did historical peoples act this way,0

cauuf4,Perception4601,askculinary,Getting pudding to set Hello everyoneI have been trying to make a blueberry mint and lemon pudding The flavor of the pudding comes out great but Im having trouble with the consistency So far my pudding has come out looking like soup Any ideas how to infuse these flavors to make a pudding with good textureThe steps I tried to make the pudding are below Use a juicer to make a liquid from the blueberry mint and lemon Make a pudding base from sugar whole milk corn starch egg yolks and a little salt Mix the juicer liquid with the pudding base Place everything mixed together on medium heat and stir occasionally About  min or so The pudding is suppose to thicken a little bit but it never does for me Turn stovetop to medium heat and continuously mix pudding for another  min At this point the pudding should have a stiffer texture but mine never does Take pudding off the heat and mix in butter Mix until butter is melted Strain pudding and put in fridge to continue setting,0

c5kfqz,BlackHorseMamba,askculinary,Can someone help me fill in the gap about what I dont know about creaming fat and sugar As Ive been baking and researching about baking Ive come confused about what the sugar is actually doing when it gets creamed into the fat Im not sure if I even used the term cream correctly there I do understand that when you cream the sugar and fat you are creating air pockets which give the space that leaveners use to expand in Peoples advice on techniques for this that Ive come across is what is confusing me Americas Test Kitchens ATK research says that using chilled butter that is defined as  degrees F or when pressed with a finger leaves a crack is superior in leavening or creating those air pockets than butter at room temp which is about  degrees F or there is no crack in the butter when pressed with a finger They also showed what happens when you use melted butter What was shown was that as the butter loses its solid nature it becomes harder to create those air pockets In my mind I akin the butter to the substance that is the wall that surrounds the air and as that gets less solid it gets increasingly difficult to trap air or create air pockets What makes butter special is that it has these betaprime crystals that are just the right size versus the larger ones found in lard which is apparently too large to hold in the air They also point out that as you beat the butter the temperature of it will rise a few degrees If I wanted to be safe I would definitely be going for the low s in butter temp To concur with ATK I have Milk Bars cookbook and Tossi goes on about creaming the butter and sugar She goes the extra mile and does it longer than most people intuitively would I think it was  minutes which is basically the time ATK uses for their pound cake recipe However when ATK cream the butter and sugar for their lemon bundt cake its only for three minutes and they dont care much about temperature of the egg other than it should be room temperature Whilst in the pound cake you need to beat the eggs before hand and then gradually add them in and beat for an additional  minutes I only note these eggs instructions parts because they say since its more difficult to incorporate a colder egg into the creamed butter and sugar you can actually break the air pockets in that time versus using room temperature eggs If I were to believe what is going on here youd want to be more careful with more delicate cakes like pound cake that doesnt rely on chemical leaveners Heres where things get tricky for me If I were to apply these principles would it be fair to say that if I wanted to have my cookies spread out less then I would use  degree butter and use room temperature eggs Also I know people chill their cookie batter before baking not just for flavor development but so that the cookies doesnt spread as much Wouldnt it be more efficient to apply and rely on these techniques than it is to chill the batter If anything once the walls that is from the butter is too warm they become weak and chilling the cookie batter doesnt really do anything to trap any more air and therefore wouldnt make your cookies spread lessrise more Another weird thing I heard about creaming was from a book called The Elements of Dessert which said that using a finer grain of sugar like superfine or powdered aides in the creaming process because it dissolves better and faster in the fat versus granulated Is this because when you cream the sugar into the butter or cream the butter and sugar Im not sure the correct way to say it the process of combining them HAS to come first and then as you beat faster you are then able to mechanically mix in AND trap the air,0

c3fgb0,Leandover,askculinary,Yogurt bacteria fermentation temperatures etc I have been making yogurt a few times I have an electric yogurt maker which works at around CMy starter is a freezedried blend of Streptococcus thermophilus Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus Apparently they work synergisticallyDespite the names L bulgaricus is actually slightly more thermophilic than S thermophilus S thermophilus seems to be most active at C Lower or higher temperatures result in lower lactic acid production L bulgaricus seems to be ok in a wide range but maybe around CCAnyway I am looking at a supplier of starter cultures they offer S thermophilus L bulgaricus Balkan S thermophilus L bulgaricus Bulgarian it is not clear if there is a significant difference in the blend S thermophilus L bulgaricus L acidophilus L acidophilus  S thermophilus L bulgaricus  Bifidobacterium bifidum B longum biotypes S thermophilus L acidophilus L gasseri L rhamnosus B longum biotypes B adolescentis B breve in capsule form rather than sachetApparently the term probiotic refers to any live bacteria consumed as distinct from a prebiotic which stimulates the growth of existing bacteria within the gutIn addition if you are making or consuming yogurt there is no particular guarantee that the bacteria are live  the bacteria ferment producing lactic acid but they may in fact be dead at the point of consumption The fermentation process obviously does produce various compounds resulting in the flavour profile of the yogurt but I guess the bacteria themselves dont taste of anythingIt seems that neither S thermophilus nor L bulgaricus are considered probiotic  while they are live bacteria they are not there for any putative benefit to the gut  but simply to ferment the milk into yogurtOTOH L acidophilus IS considered a probiotic bacteria and also can ferment milk alone though it does not thicken as much as traditional strains From what I can gather the characteristic of L acidophilus is a slower ferment and more acetic acid relative to lactic acid when compared to L bulgaricus S thermophilus does not seem to be a significant source of acetic acid Note that if you use a S thermophilus amp L acidophilus blend or indeed S thermophilus L acidophilus and L bulgaricus and ferment at high temperatures it seems that the L acidophilus wont be doing much of the work Also if you want a pure L acidophilus ferment then you should likely seek out an adjustable yogurt maker as Ive tried a couple of nonadjustable yogurt makers and they are around the C range at which temperature the L acidophilus is not growing and barely working At C it will be working possibly as high as C but a standard commercial yogurt maker will be hopeless It is slightly surprising that vendors are selling such bacteria without any warning that they wont work in common yogurt makersThe bifidobacteria otoh produce  parts acetic acid to  parts lactic acid so a pure bifido ferment would result in a vinegar yogurt Presumably for this reason probiotics may be added AFTER fermentation when temperatures have been cooled although fermentation will continue at fridge temperature such that after a month a yogurt containing L acidophilus and L bulgaricus is noticeably vinegary so you are essentially doing little more than consuming a capsule when you eat the yogurt The notion of happy bacteria producing some tasty food that you then consume and it makes you healthier seems to be a little distant from the truth as it looks like to whatever extent the Bifidobacteria are there and possibly to a lesser extent L acidophilus they are not necessarily doing the job of making a tasty food and you could just gulp a pill with the same contents  however healthy natural fermented yogurt is obviously more appealing to the average person than taking pillsAt any rate I should add that I havent tried the Bifido bacteria  obviously to the extent that they are added and are working then a vinegar flavour is part of an overall profile that may be pleasing to  me but not to youI found a bacteria table which says L delbrueckii subsp lactis this is NOT the same as L lactis  range C optimum C L bulgaricus  optimum C L helveticus probiotic used in cheese possible use in yogurt   C optimum C The three above have a similar lactic acid concentration     L acidophilus C optimum C  lactic acid As with the other three this is listed as homofermentative ie lactic acid as the primary byproduct rather than multiple main byproducts However the pH and acid concentration is higher suggesting a milder yogurt L kefir Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens  L brevis  C optimum  heterofermentative  lactic acid L casei  again probiotic used in Cheddar added to some commercial probiotic drinks Appears to be similar to L acidophilus in that it requires fermentation at C A graph I found showed a pH of  at  hours reaching a peak of pH  at  hours However whereas commercial yogurts are from what I can see NEVER sold below  pH ranging from  pH taste testers preferred L casei yogurt at  hours or beyond ie when the pH reached its most acidic or longer It is also noted that beyond  hours L bulgaricus start to die it is my understanding that in commercial production you would blast chill your yogurt but for both L acidophilus and L casei they continued to be viable and peak amino acid production was at  hours even while the pH did not drop further Bifidobacterium  C peak C lactic acid  pH The greater risk at C is other bacteria outcompeting the desirable bacteria You can make a product called acidophilus milk by fermenting milk at C following heat treatment producing a product with a similar lactic acid content to yogurt I am not clear if this fermented acidophilus milk would turn into yogurt if fermented longer Some sources suggest that S thermophilus amp L acidophilus is used to create a milder

c3dhhr,RedExorcist,askculinary,Looking for some ideas for sweet dishes involving preserved lemons and questions about cooking and flavour Hello peopleampxBI have recently finished a batch of preserved lemons that have been developing nicely over the last  months I tried them today by including them in a ricotta pasta sauce to give some extra lemon flavour and I very much enjoy the strong citrus notes they give together with a little bit of that fermentation funk I did find that they bring a little bit of sweetness to the dish as well so Id like to see what can be done with them in sweet dishesampxBHere is my problem I do not wish to try and mess too much with the funky flavour that they have developed so far and I am worried that heating them will result in a disappearance of those notes I thought of things like jam and simple syrups infused with the lemons but both require heating A good example of something I think would work well is a lassi that uses preserved lemons but I would like to try and bake them into perhaps scones or shortbreads Perhaps a cream cheese topping with preserved lemons or a cheesecake infused with them could be a good ideaampxBDoes anyone have experience with how cooking preserved lemons affect their flavour and using preserved lemons in sweet dishes Any help would be appreciated,0

bw3cx1,m4gpi,askculinary,Is there a better word for Christmassy spices Edit I didnt quite make myself clear I wasnt looking for a synonym to Christmas spice as in holiday winter festive etc because that excludes a lot of the uses of these spices beyond western holidays and baked goods In fact I wanted to not use a seasonal connotation because a its summer and these are summer pickles and b Ill be sharing them with friends who are from Asia and South Asia and I didnt want to call them holiday pickles But these spices are clearly similar in terms of flavor profiles and I thought there might be a catchall term for these particular kinds of spices sort of like herbs paparikas etc It seems the best phrase for what I was looking for is warm spices original postIs there a categorical name for these spices cinnamon allspice cloves nutmeg cardamom etc While most of them originate in Asianeastern cuisines and are not necessarily sweet dish spices in western cuisine we associate them with desserts and to some extent holiday baking The real reason Im asking is Im developing a vegetable pickling spice mix that leans quite heavily on some of these spices and Id rather not call them Christmas pickles or Pumpkin Spice pickles Thank you in advance,0

cit2ug,[deleted],askculinary,How do I modify recipes without them getting screwed up So the problem with a lot of recipes especially those in the seafood area is that they contain food I cannot have Either ingredients that would kill me if eaten or others Ive completely cut out due to intolerance or diet reasons Growing up my childhood was split between living in the south and west I enjoy a myriad of recipes and food from cultures found in both areas I dont know how to cook so whenever I try to substitute ingredients the end result ends up tasting terrible I suppose thats actually true for anything I try to cook Right now Im really craving some gumbo but I cant find a single recipe without shrimp or other shellfish in it Then theres the problem of finding good Andouille sausage in California My main question is if I need to subsitute or cut something out how do I know what to add  not to add There are sometimes many different substitutes for one thing Obviously they all taste different and can change the final outcome of a dish,0

cis7ev,PotatosBitch,askculinary,Can I freeze cooked chicken wrapped in foil We bought a bunch of chicken breasts a couple of weeks back but no body bothered to portion them out before throwing them in the freezer so I had to defrost the whole lot to cook a bit of chicken so I lightly seasoned the rest of the chicken breasts wrapped them individually in foil and baked them I am planning to freeze them once theyve cooled so them whoever wants chicken can defrost it then chuck it into whatever sauce they wantMy question is can I simple just place them in a freezer bag wrapped in the foil that they were baked in or do I have to take them out of the foil then place them into the freezer bag,0

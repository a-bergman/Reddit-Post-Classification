3,cbmrz3,Weekly menu-setting has changed my life,"I’ve always enjoyed cooking, but in the past struggled constantly with what to cook. I would get home after work and honestly the stress of having to decide what my wife or I would be cooking that night led to us just grabbing fast food a lot of the time. Grocery shopping was a crap-shoot, and a lot of food ended up getting thrown away without getting cooked because “well I’ll make SOMETHING with chicken this week” just didn’t always pan out.

So about 5 months ago my wife brought home a menu board she’d printed out and framed (link below) since she was as frustrated with it as I was. At first I thought it was kind of overkill but after a couple weeks I completely bought in. 

We sat down and made a list of every dish we can cook, by category (roasts/stews, Chicken, etc), and every Sunday we pull out the list and go through and pick a dish for each day, then go shopping based on that. We even consolidated the recipes for everything we use recipes for in one place and basically have our own little cook book on the computer. We also ‘program in’ leftovers, which has reduced those going to waste as well.

Maybe this is something most of you already do, but growing up my family always played it by ear so this level of planning had never occurred to me. We are eating better, cheaper food than before with more variety and the stress of deciding what to make is way reduced. We don’t stick 100% to the menu, sometimes days get flipped around or something comes up and we do have to grab take out, but it happens way, way less than before we had a plan. It’s great and I suggest everybody that is having trouble with what to cook give it a shot.

13,cbrdcf,Ideas to elevate fruit shortcake dessert,"Hi all, 

I'm hoping to pick the collective brain of this great group!

I'm looking to make a dessert that would be an ""elevated"" version of a fruit shortcake. The brief background is I'm cooking a fancy dinner in honor of a dear family member who loved to cook and passed away unexpectedly. I'm trying to reference some of her favorite foods, but dress them up for the occasion.

One thing she loved was to just get a store-bought angel food cake, put some fresh fruit and whipped cream on top, done. 

I'm trying to think of ways to push that a bit. Maybe a savory cake like a rosemary shortbread instead of the angel food? Would that be too heavy? Maybe a nice spice- infused drizzle of some kind? Should I poach the fruit in something?

One extra challenge is I'd like to be flexible on what fruit to use -- I'll be out of town for the cooking and not sure what will be looking best at the market. Hoping for stone fruit but might be strawberries or something.

19,cbtax0,Any Chinese cooks able to help me adjust my “red braise” recipe?,"I love making 红烧 anything (particularly pork ribs, chicken drums, chicken wings) and over the years, I’ve evolved my personal recipe into something that tastes good to me. I don’t care for super complex flavors and don’t use many of the... aromatics? spices? that many more traditional recipes call for. 

My question is, how do I make it so that the final sauce is very **shiny** and clings to the meat even after removing it from the pot? My sauce looks fine when I’m stirring it and fresh sauce is constantly coating the meat. After I take it out,  after maybe 5 minutes, the surface of the meat looks all dried out. 

I thought adding more sugar or using rock sugar would help but it hasn’t made a noticeable difference. 

I use:

1. Ginger
2. Scallion
3. Garlic
4. Dried chilis
5. 1 star anise
6. Dark soy sauce (some brand that has very thick consistency) 
7. White pepper powder
8. Five spice powder
10. Exactly 10 small chunks of rock sugar
11. Water

I cook it with the lid on until tender then remove the lid and crank up the heat to reduce. I reduce the sauce until just enough is left to comfortably coat everything, and has a good thickness.

Is this overkill? If it were just for me, I'd for sure just leave it in the fridge till I serve it, but I don't want to get anyone sick.

38,cbk3v3,Help Me Make My Pasta Cream/Sauce More Flavorful!,"Around 2 weeks ago, I made it my goal to be able to cook a decent tasting pasta dish for my family by the end of the summer. After a trip to Italy, I wanted to make some sort of a truffle cream pasta with the truffle sauce I brought back. On my first attempt, this is what I made:  [https://imgur.com/a/PZ4frRZ](https://imgur.com/a/PZ4frRZ)

&amp;#x200B;

It looked quite nice but when I tasted it, I was fairly disappointing.  It did have a nice truffle taste, but the sauce had a bland, buttery taste. Since then I have tried making the same dish 2 or 3 times and I am not getting a flavorful sauce. I was also hoping my sauce to be a bit thicker.

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients:

Spaghetti

Truffle Sauce (Mix of truffle and seasoning in oil)

Parmesan Cheese

Salt and Pepper

Butter

Heavy Cream

&amp;#x200B;

I see that there aren't many ingredients I used and I am wondering what I can use to make my sauce more flavorful. Furthermore, I would like to know how to make my sauce more thicker. Should I use more heavy cream? Less?

I really love cooking, but due to the economic crisis my country is going through, I have to cut back in costs when it comes to getting ingredients. I also am looking to improve my diet to something more healthy. I'll eat just about anything, although I am very picky when it comes to fruits. 

I managed to come up with a very delicious recipe that serves 3 people and takes only 4 main ingredients. 5 if you count the butter. It's 2 cups of white rice, 3 champignons, 3 eggs, and 2 table spoons of cream. You just have to boil the rice, and as it boils, you can chop the champignons into small chunks and then sauté them (first with water, then finish with a little bit of olive oil. You can use only water if you please) and then you scramble the eggs on butter. Once the rice is done, you mix them all together and add the cream. Season to taste, et voila!

So I make a lot of lentil stew. Usually I base it loosely on dal, which means I throw in onions, tomatoes, lentils, garlic, ginger, curry powder, and something creative to flavor it. Lately, though, I've been looking for sauce recipes that could hold up to an overnight trip through the crock pot and making those. Currently I'm eating my way through a batch that was loosely based on pad Thai peanut sauce -- coconut milk, natural peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, cayenne pepper, and a few other things. It's *quite* good.

All of that is backstory for my request: do you have a sauce that you make using the crock pot that turns out well? It doesn't necessarily have to fit with lentils in your mind -- I'll try anything once!

So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

89,cb46pu,Leftovers actually better than original — or all in my head?,"Does anyone else get surprised when they heat up some leftovers and find  that it tastes better than the night before? I have 3 possible reasons to why this is occurs (and I’m sure it’s a combination of all 3). 

1. Purely psychological: you go into the meal having lower expectations, and you’re really just happy to be able to have a quick easy meal to heat up, but surprisingly it tastes much better than expected. This is in contrast to when the deal was freshly made when you undoubtedly had higher expectations which were going to be hard to exceed. 

2. Flavors actually improve: I guess it’s no secret that many sauce based dishes or soups improve in flavor with time. (the meal that prompted me to post this had a pork/kimchi base. Over night the pork and kimchi were essentially marinating together in the fridge, and it tasted amazing today). 

3. By the time you actually ate the meal the first time you had exposed yourself to the ingredients, possibly for hours: Chances are during  meal prep/cooking you had a few bites of the various ingredients here and there. More importantly you were exposing yourself to the aromas the whole time. Therefore by the time it was actually ready to eat your body was naturally not craving the meal as much. 

Of course this doesn’t apply to all meals,  (steak or fish to name a few), but I’m just curious what other people’s opinions are on this.

2 spoons of butter

and an egg inside this thing

I had it in low fire for some time until i gave up on it, but then noticed the bottom part took a pudin-like texture after i didnt stir it for a minute or two, so and idea poped into my head

Temperature control is essential to prevent the rapid growth of foodborne pathogens during storage. 

Preparing food using thermometers correctly to ensure that it is cooked well enough to eliminate pathogens and bacteria could prevent some illness.

A recent study from Purdue researchers show one major factor why people don’t use thermometers is that celebrity chefs and others in the know rarely mention the importance of proper temperatures.

111,caxfus,"LPT: Your stove's Medium setting is NOT a temperature, it's how fast your pan will heat up, and every stove's medium is different. Use a IR thermometer instead.","I get irked when recipes say to heat your pan on Medium/High heat.  It's relatively useless because it doesn't explain what the temperature you need to get your pan to and maintain it, which is what you use the dials for.


And every stove on the market is different. There is no standard of what High/Medium/Low means.  Even the different burners of your stove/hob are different.  The big burner's low could possibly put out as much heat as the little burner's high.

Get an infrared thermometer and start learning what temperatures your pan should be at for different styles of cooking, and where the hot spots are. Then use the dials to get it to that temp. Searing?  Get it at least 400F.  Grilled cheese or pancakes?  340F is just about right. Scrambled eggs, 300F. For general cooking, I keep it at 350.

The only real benefits of the different dial settings are that a lower heat can more evenly heat a pan, creating less hot spots, and can be easier to prevent overheating since it takes longer to overheat.  But at the same time, I see way too many novice cooks using a much too cold pan to cook with.

Yesterday I did a bunch of things slightly different and they didn't turn out so good.  Can you help me identify the reason?  In short, they turned out flatter, less toothsome(softer in general), and the middles didn't seem to cook as evenly.  

What I did differently.

1.  I doubled the recipe.  The butter took way longer to brown, like 15 minutes instead of the usual 8.  Did I lose moisture maybe?
2.  I added a bit more Baking soda, about 2.1 teaspoons instead of 2.  
3.  My kitchen was hotter than usual, around 80 degrees, making the dough looser.
4. I didn't roll my dough into balls.  I just spooned them and plopped them on the baking sheet.  Does that make a difference.

Herb crusted bison roast with roasted sweet potatoes and onion cooked in the rendered fat and kerrygold butter. 


The herb blend is rosemary, thyme, fresh garlic, and oregano blended together with the slightest bit of evoo.

Sweet potatoes and onions were seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, thyme, and just enough olive oil to make it stick. 

I cooked the bison at 300 for right around 50 minutes to 1 hour. I didn't pay attention to the time as I was using my thermometer's alarm to alert me (more on this later).

About 25 minutes until done, I put the sweet potatoes and onion in the bottom of the pan and set the bison back on top.

In the last few minutes I put two nice slices of kerrygold butter on top of the bison to melt and drip down to the potatoes.

165,canemv,Help me improve a recipe (pork meat with soy sauce and honey),"So let me just start of with that I am not highly skilled in the kitchen. I cook of necessity mainly, but also enjoy making something more fancy from time to time. Recently I was experimenting with some pork chops marinated in soy sauce and honey and I want to improve the recipe as I’ll be having a date over for dinner soon. 
The way I cook it, is firstly I make a mix of melted honey and soy sauce “Ketjap Manis”. I season the meat with salt, red and black pepper and, if I have, basil. I chop the meat into smaller (not too small) pieces and leave it in the marinate for 30 minutes. After that I put the meat with the marinate in a pan with a lid (cover) and I stew the meat for about 30 minutes. 10-15 minutes after putting it the pan I add some red wine. As a side dish I prepare mashed potatoes. 
So my question is, is there a way to improve on that. What kind of ingredients way suit it better, or is there something in the way it is prepared can be improved. I was thinking about trying to cook it in the oven, but I’m not sure, as I fear I would get too dry.
So what are your recommendations?

That said, she is reaaaaally concerned with me putting together something too difficult.  We want to make some relatively simple garlic bread, and she's hoping for some kind of pasta dish now that she's comfortable with that, but she's not a tomato sauce fan.

I thought of something like chicken and mushroom-alfredo fetuccine or something along those lines... but I want to make it interesting or ""elevated"" in SOOOME way so it feels just a tiny bit more rewarding at the end.

White miso: basically an umami bomb, I put it in everything. I keep a jar of miso broth in my fridge at all times and use it to sauté vegetables. The broth is also a great tofu marinade. I add miso paste to sauces - it adds an excellent punch to tomato sauce, cheese sauces, and pesto. I whisk it into eggs when I'm breading anything. I whisk it into eggs when I'm making scrambled eggs. I put it in curry.

Red miso: for when you want that great soy sauce taste, without all the wetness. Especially excellent in fried rice but it goes great in any Asian dish.

Y'all, I love miso so much. I prefer to buy it at the Asian market near my house but it's also available at Whole Foods. Miso, especially white miso, should be a fridge staple for everyone in my opinion. I try not to eat a lot of meat, so I feel like it especially adds to meatless dishes - but it works great with meat as well. Miso is like crack to me. I'm addicted. And it like never goes bad.

That’s… an impossibly vast space to cover, so to make it all actually *possible* to tackle, let’s focus on (1) the most common tofu varieties and (2) predominantly oil based cooking methods. 

The techniques we’ll go over are:

1.	**Pan-fry/stir-fry.** Probably the most commonly seen oil-based tofu fry technique. The tofu is pan-fried until crisp and then tossed with sauce and aromatics. To illustrate this, we’ll use a basic soy sauce fried tofu.

2.	**Pan-fry/simmer.** Another oft-used approach. We’ll be showing this technique using an old-school shrimp and tofu dish that we adapted from an old Qing dynasty cookbook. 

3.	**Strictly pan-fry.** This is a less commonly seen approach that I’m hesitant to list out as its own ‘category’, as it’s predominantly only seen with one classic Chinese street food dish, *Tieban Tofu*. That said, of all these techniques it’s the one that’d be most applicable to Western cooking, so I think it’s nice one to cover.

4.	**Strictly Deep-fry.** There’s a crazy number of deep-fried tofu dishes in China, but to illustrate we’ll go over my personal favorite deep fried tofu dish, the Teochew dish “Puning Tofu”.

5.	**Deep-fry/Stir-fry/Simmer.** Show with Sichuanese Jiachang “Homestyle” tofu. Note that often pan-frying and deep-frying can be interchangeably used with this method, especially at home. 


[There’s a video to go along with this](https://youtu.be/8vWIenK4p60) – in it, you can see the last three techniques in action. For the first two techniques, I’ll be referring to an older video we made – [Fried tofu, two ways](https://youtu.be/ZjOG8chNW-M).

________________

**Tofu varieties:**

So where in god’s name to even begin here? There’s so many damn tofu products, ranging from deep-fried tofu puffs to smoked tofu to pudding-like *Douhua*. So let’s zero in on the stuff that would be commonly referred to as just “Tofu”.

In the West, if you go to a supermarket that sells tofu, you’ll probably run into two types of tofu: regular and silken. The regular tofu then ranges in firmness from Soft to Extra-Firm, while the Silken tofu’ll come in three sorts: Soft, Firm, and Extra-Firm. 

Regular tofu is made using Nigari (Magnesium chloride) as the coagulant. If you’re curious the general approach of how to make it, [I talked about it a bit in the homemade Sichuanese Douhua post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/bq3esr/recipe_sichuan_spicy_tofu_rice_douhuafan_%E8%B1%86%E8%8A%B1%E9%A5%AD/). Basically, to make tofu you follow the general process outlined there, then toss the coagulated soymilk in a specific tofu press in place of using the wooden basket. To get the varying degrees of firmness, the tofu is pressed for a longer or shorter time.

Silken tofu is made using Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) as the coagulant. Silken tofu usually isn’t pressed in the same way, but varying firmness is achieved by controlling the ratio of soybean to water in the mix.

So right. Here’s the thing that was a bit of a mindfuck for me when I first came to China – there’s not really the same soft/medium/firm categorization that exists in the West. I mean, there is, soft of… allow me to explain.

First off, the names and dominant styles of tofu are *extremely* regional in China. I’m going to explain the ‘common tofu types’ but know that these are (1) the workhorse tofus in the city *I* live, Shenzhen and (2) how they’re referred to at *my* local market. I can’t guarantee it’d be the same if you went to a market in, say, Shanghai. That said? Shenzhen’s a migrant city with folks all around the country, so I think it’s still pretty indicative of the country at large.

1.	*Shigao Tofu (石膏豆腐).* Shigao Tofu is made using gypsum as the coagulant – the Western counterpart would be ‘firm silken tofu’. It’s pretty delicate – usually used in soups or stews. The dominant tofu in Cantonese cuisine.

2.	*Yanshui Tofu (盐水豆腐).* Yansui tofu is made using nigari as the coagulant.  It usually ends up a bit firmer than the Shigao tofu – it’s the sort that’s in your Mapo Tofu. Depending on where you are in China, it can also be referred to as Lushui tofu or Hakka tofu (I’m sure there’s way more names). In the West, this would correspond with soft tofu, though in recipes that use it you could also use medium tofu.

3.	*Lao Tofu (老豆腐).* Lao Tofu starts out at Yanshui tofu (i.e. a nigari tofu) but’s then pressed for longer. It’s the dominant tofu style in the North of China. 

Generally speaking, we like to use Shigao tofu (i.e. firm silken) with water-based cooking methods, Yanshui tofu (i.e. soft) deep-frying, and Lao Tofu (i.e. firm) pan-frying. Lots of exceptions there but that’s usually our approach.

**How to cut tofu:**

Tofu’s pretty simple to cut. A few of the most common cuts:

1.	*Sheets.* Slice the tofu in half lengthwise, and then cut in into 1 cm pieces working perpendicular from that cut.

2.	*Cubes.* Slice your tofu in half lengthwise. Then, slice down to get one inch strips, and finally cut in the other direction to get one inch cubes.

3.	*Triangles.* Slice your tofu in half crosswise. Cut each crosswise piece in half at a 45 degree bias. Flip each piece up, and cut each into ~3 pieces, about 1cm each.

**How to Prep Tofu for frying:**

Don’t.

That’s a bit of a strong statement, but… I’ve just gotta get something off my chest real quick. I see a *lot* of sources online – sources I love, places like Serious Eats and BA… recommend you buy firm tofu, and then press it further before you cook it. I see this advice everywhere from AskCulinary to Buzzfeed Tasty videos – it’s feels like it’s starting to become gospel. 

I’ve also **never** seen anyone in China press their tofu at home. Ever. That’s the fucking point of firm tofu – it’s pressed. 

I’ve gotten into arguments on this very topic, and the common response is that “well, in the West, we just like it firmer and meatier”. And I mean, if you just like it firmer than firm… I’m certainly not going to stop you. We’ve all got preferences. I like overcooked root vegetables, my parents like their steaks well done. But what I’d argue against is the ‘meatier’ claim. 

When we cook meat we go to great pains to make it as ‘juicy’ as possible – brine, marinade, deep fry, pass through oil, whatever. So why when people in the West cook tofu do they go to such lengths to remove almost every bit of moisture they possibly can? You wouldn’t be mimicking meat… you’d be at best mimicking overcooked meat. And I mean really, tofu’s not the best mock meat anyhow – that crown likely belongs to Seitan (i.e. wheat gluten).

I can think of one and only one situation where it’d make sense to press tofu at home – I know in some supermarkets in the states a nondescript box of “Medium” tofu’s all you can find. If you have medium tofu and you want to morph it into firm tofu… totally. Press it yourself, good idea. Otherwise? I dunno. Feels superfluous at best.

Further, many people advocate coating tofu in cornstarch before frying it. While it wouldn’t really hurt too much (and I’m *sure* there’s some coated tofu dishes out there that I’m not thinking of)… tofu generally doesn’t need cornstarch, tofu needs patience. It’s one of the cool things about frying tofu – the outside tends to get nice and crisp.

_________

**A note on poaching tofu cubes in warm salt water:**

Ok, so I said ‘don’t prep tofu’. There *is* one thing you can do if you feel so lead. If you’re using soft Yanshui tofu in something saucy, you can poach the tofu in hot, salty water for ~3 minutes… then leave it in there until it’s ready to use. Yanshui tofu can sort of have a slight ‘grassy’ undertone that you might not want to flavor your sauce with. The poach will help dampen that taste, as well as help form the tofu pieces.

**Method #1: Pan-fry then Stir-fry.**

High level overview here: 

Cut firm tofu into 1 cm pieces or triangles --&gt; Pan-fry on medium heat for 5-8 minutes until the bottom is evenly golden brown --&gt; Flip, fry for ~5 minutes --&gt; Remove the tofu --&gt; Fry aromatics --&gt; Add back the tofu --&gt; Add seasoning (e.g. wine, soy sauce, salt, sugar, MSG, etc)

*Ingredients, Soy Sauce Fried Tofu:*

1.	*Firm Tofu (老豆腐)* One block, 400g. Cut in half and then into one cm pieces. 

2.	*Green onion (葱), about three sprigs, separated into the white part (to use as an aromatic) and the green part (to finish the dish).* Cut these into about two inch sections.

3.	*Shallot (干葱), 1. Sliced.* If you’re somewhere where you can only get those tiny little shallots, use 2-3.

4.	*Liaojiu (料酒), 1 tbsp.* A.k.a. Shaoxing wine, Huangjiu, Chinese cooking wine.

5.	*Light Soy Sauce (生抽), 1.5 tbsp.*

6.	*Sugar, 1 tsp.*

7.	*Oil, 3-4 tbsp.* For frying. Quick note that this amount – 3-4 tbsp – is if you’re using a round bottomed wok. If using a flat bottomed wok (or some other piece of kitchen cookware), add enough oil to get about 1-2 cm up from the bottom of the wok.

*Process, Soy Sauce fried tofu:*

1. *Cut the tofu and aromatics, and thoroughly dry the tofu.* When working with firm tofu, there’s a small tough bit on the very top and bottom of the tofu.  This is totally optional, but we slice that off in order to get a more even texture from the tofu.  Slice the tofu in half lengthwise, and then cut in into 1 cm pieces working from the other direction.  Thoroughly pat the tofu dry with some paper towels – we don’t want the tofu to be popping like crazy when we add it to the oil to fry.  Chop up the aromatics – slicing the green onion into two inch pieces and separating the white part from the green part.  Thinly slice up the shallot and toss it together with the white part of the green onion.

2. *Longyau, then with the heat on medium carefully add the tofu into the wok.* As always, first longyau – get that wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil, and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface.  With the heat on medium, add in the tofu pieces.  If you’re a pro you can carefully slide them all in at once, but to make sure that the tofu doesn’t pile and break (worst case scenario when making this dish), we recommend adding the pieces one by one.

3. *Let the tofu panfry for five to eight minutes until the bottom is nice and golden brown.* Same deal as whenever you’re panfrying anything from any cuisine ever – don’t touch the tofu.  Let the tofu develop a crust and get nice and golden brown.  If you got a round bottom wok like us though, you’re gunna want to tilt the wok to each side to move the oil and ensure the tofu cooks evenly.

4. *Flip the tofu and cook on the other side for five minutes.  Take out the tofu once each side is crispy and golden brown.* Find a tiny plate or something to put your tofu on… this’ll be out for like three minutes tops.

5. *In the same oil, same medium heat… fry the white part of the green onion and the shallot for 1-2 minutes, then add back the tofu.*  Just fry until they start to smell real nice, then add back the tofu.  Give it a quick mix together (~15 seconds).

6. *Up the heat to high, then add the liaojiu over the spatula and around the sides of the wok and give it a quick mix. Then do the same thing with the soy sauce.* Adding these liquids on the spatula and over the sides of the wok’ll help ensure that they sizzle and quickly reduce instead of collect at the bottom and start simmering.  After each addition of liquid, give it about a ~15 second mix.  Make sure there’s no visible liaojiu in the wok before you add in the soy sauce.    

7. *Add the sugar, fry together until the sugar dissolves (~30 seconds).  Add the green part of the green onion, shut off the heat, give it a quick mix, and out.*

**Method #2: Pan-fry then Simmer:**

High level overview here: 

Cut firm tofu into 1 cm pieces or triangles --&gt; Fry on medium heat for 5-8 minutes until bottom is evenly golden brown --&gt; Flip, fry for five minutes more --&gt; Add liquid --&gt; Cover, simmer for 20 minutes --&gt; Season --&gt; Simmer, allowing liquid to ~90% absorb into the tofu, ~20 minutes.

*Ingredients, Fried Tofu ‘braised’ with Shrimp (蒋侍郎豆腐):*

1. *Firm Tofu (老豆腐/板豆腐), one block, 400g.* Same deal. Cut in half then into one cm pieces.  

2. *Dried shrimp (虾米), 15g to be simmered in two cups water.* Nature’s MSG. 

3. *Oil -or- Lard (猪油), 3-4 tbsp*.  For frying.  Lard is a great frying oil for tofu.

4. *Rice wine (米酒), ~¼ cup.* So classically, this specific dish would be simmered in a specific sweet kind of Shaoxing wine. But here’s the thing – in the West the vast majority of stuff that’s labelled ‘Shaoxing’ is… salted. Alcohols laws are fun. So just grab a nicer sort of rice wine – something like a Japanese sake would work great (don’t waste an expensive one though).

5. *Light soy sauce (生抽), 2 tbsp.* To be added near the end of cooking.

6. *Sugar, 1 tsp.* Added together with the soy sauce.

7. *Green onion (葱), green part only, ~3 sprigs.* Cut into two inch sections.

**Process, Fried tofu ‘braised’ with shrimp**

So I’m putting ‘braised’ in quotes because using the English terminology ‘braise’ doesn’t really make a hell of a lot of sense with tofu.  It’s just sorta the go-to translation for the Chinese word ‘men’ (simmering in sauce) and there’s enough similarities that you could kinda think of it in that way.

1.	*Rinse the dried shrimp to get the dust off, then simmer in two cups water – covered – for one hour.*  This is the first time I’ve personally seen this method, and holy hell… I was just blown away by the end result.  Those Qing dynasty cooks knew their shit.  The end result of this stuff after an hour long simmer is basically just concentrated umami juice. The first time I tasted this dish I just couldn’t believe that there was no MSG added in here… it’s *that* rich in glutamate.

2.	*Cut and fry the tofu in accordance to steps #1-4 above.* With the obvious exception of cutting up the white-part-of-the-green-onion and slicing the shallots.  This dish’ll only have some green onion sections that we toss in near the end.

3.	*Once the tofu is nice and golden brown on both sides, add in the shrimp, the shrimp liquid, and the rice wine.  Cover and ‘braise’ for 20 minutes on medium low.* This’s gunna (1) let the raw alcohol bite of the rice wine cook out (2) infuse the tofu with that delicious shrimp umami liquid.  Random note that glutamic acid is water and not alcohol soluble – the rice wine is more for taste and to help bring out the other flavonoids in the dish.

4.	*After 20 minutes, add in the soy sauce and sugar. Let that continue to cook down on medium-low for a 2-3 minutes, flipping the tofu to make sure both sides absorb the sauce.* So what you’re looking for is the liquid to be about 90% reduced/absorbed into the tofu.  This should take 15-25 minutes.  Add in the soy sauce and sugar, making sure the sugar dissolves into the liquid.  Let that reduce and absorb into the tofu, flipping to make sure both sides get that delicious liquid.

5.	*Once the sauce is completely absorbed, shut off the heat and mix in the green onion.* The green onion here is mostly for fragrance and color.

**Method #3: Strictly Pan-frying**

Cut firm tofu into large 2cm blocks --&gt; Lightly oil a large skillet --&gt; Add tofu, turn heat to medium --&gt; Brush a touch of oil on top side --&gt; Smother with way too much spice mix --&gt; Fry for 5 minutes --&gt; Rearrange if needed, fry for 5 minutes more --&gt; Optionally chop into cubes

*Ingredients, Street food style Tieban Tofu:*

This dish’s a classic a nightmarkets in China – you’ll usually see the tofu slowly frying on a flat top, smothered in a type of Chinese BBQ spice mix, and then chopped into bite sized pieces to serve.

1.	*Firm tofu (老豆腐), 2 blocks, ~800g.* Cut into larger ~2 cm pieces – four slices per block. This needs to be thicker because we can’t have bubbling oil muffing up and making our spice mix clump.

2.	*Oil.* For brushing. Peanut oil or sunflower oil are nice.

3.	*Scallions.* Sliced, for garnish.

4.	*Spice mix: 1 star anise (八角), ½ tsp whole Sichuan peppercorns (花椒), ½ tsp cumin seeds (孜然), ½ tbsp Perilla seeds (苏子) -or- up the cumin seed by 1 tsp, ¼ tsp white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp ginger powder (姜粉), ¼ tsp garlic powder (大蒜粉), 2 tbsp chili powder (辣椒面), 1 tbsp salt, ½ tbsp MSG (味精), 1 tsp sugar.* These’ll all get ground together. Perilla seeds are also used in Korean cuisine so you might be able to try your luck there. For the chili powder, you’ll want one that’s not overly fiery, so the bog standard cayenne pepper from the bottle should work great.

That spice mix above’s one of the classic spice mixes used in Chinese BBQ. Just add in a bit of anti-caking agents and you’ve basically got what the street vendors use.

*Process:  Street food style Tieban Tofu:*

1.	*Grind together the spice powder.* First grind together the star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, and cumin seeds. Then add everything except the salt/sugar/MSG and grind again. Finally, add the salt/sugar/MSG and give it a final grind. The reason the salt/sugar/MSG is added at the end is so that it doesn’t cake.

2.	*Brush the widest skillet you have with a thin layer of oil.* Less oil for this one because any oil bubbling over the top’ll muff up the layer of spice – this’s kinda mimicking Chinese BBQ dishes here.

3.	*Add the tofu to the pan, brush on a top layer of oil, and smother with the spice mix.* I know ‘smother’ isn’t really a proper amount but… just use your own judgement. [Take a look at a picture of how much we added](https://i.imgur.com/df4kE5U.jpg) if you need. 

4.	*Fry the tofu for 5 minutes, then rearrange if needed.* The street food vendors use a flat top so they can cook these nice and even. For us on a stove, rearranging halfway through’s a nice idea.

5.	*Fry for 5 minutes more, and with a minute to go top with sliced scallions.*

6.	*Optionally chop into 2 cm cubes.* This’s the way they’ll often do it on the street, then toss it in a bit of a plastic cup, then eat with disposable chopsticks.

**Method #4: Strictly Deep-Frying**

With deep-frying, it can often be nice to use a softer tofu. The outside of the tofu’ll form a nice crust, while the moisture on the inside will evaporate and cause the tofu to puff up.

Note that this is **not** how they make tofu puffs – tofu puffs are made using a very firm mix of 1:4 beans to water, but then including agents like ammonium carbonate, borax, and baking soda in the soy milk blend. However, if you search online in Chinese for DIY tofu puffs, they’ll often (erroneously, IMHO) use deep fried soft tofu as a base. 

High level overview:

Cut tofu into 1 cm triangles --&gt; Add to oil at 180C over max flame --&gt; Temp should lower to 150-160C --&gt; Allow tofu to form and float --&gt; Break apart any stuck pieces --&gt; Lower flame to medium-low, fry at 140C for eight minutes 

*Ingredients, Puning Tofu:*

Ok, so… this specific dish Puning tofu traditionally uses its own special tofu product here (also called ‘Puning tofu’). What Puning tofu is is a soft nigari tofu where the soy milk has some sweet potato starch mixed in… then the tofu pieces are individually pressed (and cut in half before frying).

You know how I just said that soft tofu puffs up really nice when deep-frying? Yeah… it also loves to collapse after. In an average batch of deep-fried tofu you’ll likely have ~½ collapse on you… it’s fine, still tasty, but way less easy on the eyes. The starch in Puning tofu, meanwhile, allows it to maintain that ‘puffy’ appearance. 

Where I live in Shenzhen sometimes we see restaurants make this exact sub – soft tofu for Puning tofu – if they have sourcing problems with the latter (as a city with a bunch of Teochew migrants, the Puning tofu usually runs out at our local market by ~9am). Still works. So if you happen to find Puning tofu use *that* otherwise don’t hesitate to reach for soft.

1.	 *Puning tofu -or- soft tofu, ~400g.* 

2.	*Oil: 2 cups.* For frying. Peanut’s nice. Two cups is if you use a round bottomed wok for deep frying. Heavily recommended, you’ll need way less oil in a wok. If using a Dutch oven use like the 50 gallons of oil or whatever you need to actually fill that up proper [/s, if it needed to be said].

3.	*For the sauce: 25g Chinese chives (韭菜), ½ tsp salt, optional 1 tsp fish sauce (鱼露), ½ cup water.* Fish sauce is a thing in Teochew dipping sauces, I swear.

*Process, Puning Tofu:*

1.	*Cut the tofu into triangles.* If actually using Puning tofu, just cut those little blocks in half.

2.	*In a wok, heat the oil up until 180C, then drop in the tofu slices.* For best results I’d suggest no more than ten slices at a time, else you could start to flirt with crowding.

3.	*Continue over max flame, until the tofu slices begin to float, ~3 minutes.* Once you drop the tofu slices in, it’ll likely lower the temperature to 150-160C. That’s fine. The tofu’ll also start to stick slightly, also totally normal… just let it form and gently break them apart with chopsticks. 

4.	*Lower the flame to medium-low, fry for 8 minutes at 140C.* Or until puffy, golden brown, and the exterior begins to slightly break down. Flip periodically.

5.	*Remove the tofu pieces, lay on a paper-towel lined plate.*

6.	*To make the sauce: mince the jiucai, toss in a bowl. Add the salt and mix it into the Jiucai. Then add the fish sauce and do the same. Then add the water.*

________________

**Method #5: Deep Fry, then Stir Fry, then Simmer**

Note again that you can either deep fry or pan fry your tofu here. If pan-frying, choose firm tofu. If deep-frying, choose soft tofu.

Basic high level overview:

Panfry according to method #2 -or- deep-fry according to method #4 (though after they begin floating, they only need ~1 minute) --&gt; Stir-fry aromatics --&gt; Add back tofu --&gt; Add sauce --&gt; Let sauce reduce by ~1/4 --&gt; Add vegetables, let cook for ~30 seconds --&gt; Thicken with slurry

*Ingredients, Sichuan Jiachang Tofu:*

1.	*One block tofu – soft or firm – ~400g.* Cut into 1 cm pieces. Soft for deep frying, firm if pan-frying.

2.	*Sichuan Chili Bean Paste (郫县豆瓣酱), 1 tbsp.* I.e. Pixian douban. 

3.	*Aromatics: 2 cloves garlic, ~1 inch ginger.* Both thinly sliced.

4.	*Sauce: 1 cup water or simple homestyle stock (毛汤), ¼ tsp stock concentrate (鸡汁/瑶柱汁) if using water, 1 tbsp light soy sauce (生抽), ¼ tsp salt, ½ tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp white pepper powder (白胡椒粉).* For the stock concentrate, we often use the scallop or abalone sauce varieties simply because they taste good.

5.	*Green garlic (蒜苗), 2 springs.* Cut into two inch sections. Green garlic’s classic with this flavor but ~3 scallions would also be perfectly fine.

6.	*1 mild green chili (请教).* Cut into diamonds. Something like an Anaheim would work great.

7.	*Dried Mu’er Wood Ear Mushroom, 5g.* Reconstituted in cool water for ~30 minutes. Skip if you can’t find these.

8.	*Optional: pork belly (五花肉), 30g.* Sliced into ~3mm pieces. To be rendered out and form the base of the stir-fry.  

9.	*Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), 1 tbsp.* For use while stir-frying.

10.	*Slurry of 1 tbsp cornstarch (生粉) mixed with 3 tbsp water.* For use while stir-frying.

11.	*Sprinkle of MSG (味精).* Optional.

12.	*Toasted sesame oil (麻油), ½ tsp.* For finishing the sitr-fry.

*Process: Sichuan Jiachang Tofu:*

1.	*Slice the chilis, the green garlic, and the tofu. Reconstitute the wood ear mushrooms in cool water. Prepare the sauce. Optionally mince the chili bean paste.* You can mince chili bean paste so that you don’t have… broad beans… floating around. We opted not to do that in the video, instead breaking them apart with a spatula when stir-frying. Either way.

2.	*Pan-fry or deep fry the tofu.* If pan-frying, refer to methods #1 and #2. If deep-frying, follow method #4 above, but once the tofu is floating, you only need to give it 30-60 more seconds. We don’t really need the tofu to puff up here, we just want it to form together so it doesn’t break while stir-frying and simmering. 

3.	*Stir-fry, then simmer.* As always, first *longyau*: get your wok piping hot, add in the oil – here, about ½ tbsp (or ~2 tbsp if skipping the pork), and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Heat on medium now:

* Pork belly, in. Fry for ~3 minutes until much of the oil’s rendered out… about ~2-3 tbsp in all. 

* Shut off the heat, add in the chili bean paste. Make sure the paste isn’t burning, then swap the flame to medium-low.

* Fry the chili bean paste for ~2-3 minutes until it combines with the oil, and then re-separates (kind of akin to some curries). This process is called ‘zuochu hongyou’ (frying out the red oil), and is very important in Sichuan chili oil based dishes.

* Aromatics, in. Swap flame to medium high. ~30 second stir-fry.

* Swirl in the ~1 tbsp liaojiu wine around the sides of the wok. Super brief mix.

* Tofu, in. Super brief mix. 

* Mu’er wood ear mushrooms, in. Super brief mix.

* Sauce, in. Up the flame to high to bring to a boil. 

* Let boil for ~5 minutes uncovered, or until reduced by ~1/4. 

* Add chili and green garlic. Mix and continue to cook for ~30 seconds. If using scallion, only cook for ~5-10 seconds.

* Sprinkle of MSG, in. Quick mix. Heat off.

* Toasted sesame oil, in. Quick mix.

firmer than the Shigao tofu  its the sort thats in your Mapo Tofu Depending on where you are in China it can also be referred to as Lushui tofu or Hakka tofu Im sure theres way more names In the West this would correspond with soft tofu though in recipes that use it you could also use medium tofuLao Tofu  Lao Tofu starts out at Yanshui tofu ie a nigari tofu buts then pressed for longer Its the dominant tofu style in the North of China Generally speaking we like to use Shigao tofu ie firm silken with waterbased cooking methods Yanshui tofu ie soft deepfrying and Lao Tofu ie firm panfrying Lots of exceptions there but thats usually our approachHow to cut tofuTofus pretty simple to cut A few of the most common cutsSheets Slice the tofu in half lengthwise and then cut in into  cm pieces working perpendicular from that cutCubes Slice your tofu in half lengthwise Then slice down to get one inch strips and finally cut in the other direction to get one inch cubesTriangles Slice your tofu in half crosswise Cut each crosswise piece in half at a  degree bias Flip each piece up and cut each into  pieces about cm each How to Prep Tofu for fryingDontThats a bit of a strong statement but Ive just gotta get something off my chest real quick I see a lot of sources online  sources I love places like Serious Eats and BA recommend you buy firm tofu and then press it further before you cook it I see this advice everywhere from AskCulinary to Buzzfeed Tasty videos  its feels like its starting to become gospel Ive also never seen anyone in China press their tofu at home Ever Thats the fucking point of firm tofu  its pressed Ive gotten into arguments on this very topic and the common response is that well in the West we just like it firmer and meatier And I mean if you just like it firmer than firm Im certainly not going to stop you Weve all got preferences I like overcooked root vegetables my parents like their steaks well done But what Id argue against is the meatier claim When we cook meat we go to great pains to make it as juicy as possible  brine marinade deep fry pass through oil whatever So why when people in the West cook tofu do they go to such lengths to remove almost every bit of moisture they possibly can You wouldnt be mimicking meat youd be at best mimicking overcooked meat And I mean really tofus not the best mock meat anyhow  that crown likely belongs to Seitan ie wheat glutenI can think of one and only one situation where itd make sense to press tofu at home  I know in some supermarkets in the states a nondescript box of Medium tofus all you can find If you have medium tofu and you want to morph it into firm tofu totally Press it yourself good idea Otherwise I dunno Feels superfluous at bestFurther many people advocate coating tofu in cornstarch before frying it While it wouldnt really hurt too much and Im sure theres some coated tofu dishes out there that Im not thinking of tofu generally doesnt need cornstarch tofu needs patience Its one of the cool things about frying tofu  the outside tends to get nice and crispA note on poaching tofu cubes in warm salt waterOk so I said dont prep tofu There is one thing you can do if you feel so lead If youre using soft Yanshui tofu in something saucy you can poach the tofu in hot salty water for  minutes then leave it in there until its ready to use Yanshui tofu can sort of have a slight grassy undertone that you might not want to flavor your sauce with The poach will help dampen that taste as well as help form the tofu piecesMethod  Panfry then StirfryHigh level overview here Cut firm tofu

part to use as an aromatic and the green part to finish the dish Cut these into about two inch sectionsShallot   Sliced If youre somewhere where you can only get those tiny little shallots use Liaojiu   tbsp Aka Shaoxing wine Huangjiu Chinese cooking wineLight Soy Sauce   tbspSugar  tspOil  tbsp For frying Quick note that this amount   tbsp  is if youre using a round bottomed wok If using a flat bottomed wok or some other piece of kitchen cookware add enough oil to get about  cm up from the bottom of the wokProcess Soy Sauce fried tofu Cut the tofu and aromatics and thoroughly dry the tofu When working with firm tofu theres a small tough bit on the very top and bottom of the tofu  This is totally optional but we slice that off in order to get a more even texture from the tofu  Slice the tofu in half lengthwise and then cut in into  cm pieces working from the other direction  Thoroughly pat the tofu dry with some paper towels  we dont want the tofu to be popping like crazy when we add it to the oil to fry  Chop up the aromatics  slicing the green onion into two inch pieces and separating the white part from the green part  Thinly slice up the shallot and toss it together with the white part of the green onion Longyau then with the heat on medium carefully add the tofu into the wok As always first longyau  get that wok piping hot shut off the heat add in the oil and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface  With the heat on medium add in the tofu pieces  If youre a pro you can carefully slide them all in at once but to make sure that the tofu doesnt pile and break worst case scenario when making this dish we recommend adding the pieces one by one Let the tofu panfry for five to eight minutes until the bottom is nice and golden brown Same deal as whenever youre panfrying anything from any cuisine ever  dont touch the tofu  Let the tofu develop a crust and get nice and golden brown  If you got a round bottom wok like us though youre gunna want to tilt the wok to each side to move the oil and ensure the tofu cooks evenly Flip the tofu and cook on the other side for five minutes  Take out the tofu once each side is crispy and golden brown Find a tiny plate or something to put your tofu on thisll be out for like three minutes tops In the same oil same medium heat fry the white part of the green onion and the shallot for  minutes then add back the tofu  Just fry until they start to smell real nice then add back the tofu  Give it a quick mix together  seconds Up the heat to high then add the liaojiu over the spatula and around the sides of the wok and give it a quick mix Then do the same thing with the soy sauce Adding these liquids on the spatula and over the sides of the wokll help ensure that they sizzle and quickly reduce instead of collect at the bottom and start simmering  After each addition of liquid give it about a  second mix  Make sure theres no visible liaojiu in the wok before you add in the soy sauce     Add the sugar fry together until the sugar dissolves  seconds  Add the green part of the green onion shut off the heat give it a quick mix and outMethod  Panfry then SimmerHigh level overview here Cut firm tofu into  cm pieces

MSG  Oil or Lard   tbsp  For frying  Lard is a great frying oil for tofu Rice wine   cup So classically this specific dish would be simmered in a specific sweet kind of Shaoxing wine But heres the thing  in the West the vast majority of stuff thats labelled Shaoxing is salted Alcohols laws are fun So just grab a nicer sort of rice wine  something like a Japanese sake would work great dont waste an expensive one though Light soy sauce   tbsp To be added near the end of cooking Sugar  tsp Added together with the soy sauce Green onion  green part only  sprigs Cut into two inch sectionsProcess Fried tofu braised with shrimpSo Im putting braised in quotes because using the English terminology braise doesnt really make a hell of a lot of sense with tofu  Its just sorta the goto translation for the Chinese word men simmering in sauce and theres enough similarities that you could kinda think of it in that wayRinse the dried shrimp to get the dust off then simmer in two cups water  covered  for one hour  This is the first time Ive personally seen this method and holy hell I was just blown away by the end result  Those Qing dynasty cooks knew their shit  The end result of this stuff after an hour long simmer is basically just concentrated umami juice The first time I tasted this dish I just couldnt believe that there was no MSG added in here its that rich in glutamateCut and fry the tofu in accordance to steps  above With the obvious exception of cutting up the whitepartofthegreenonion and slicing the shallots  This dishll only have some green onion sections that we toss in near the endOnce the tofu is nice and golden brown on both sides add in the shrimp the shrimp liquid and the rice wine  Cover and braise for  minutes on medium low Thiss gunna  let the raw alcohol bite of the rice wine cook out  infuse the tofu with that delicious shrimp umami liquid  Random note that glutamic acid is water and not alcohol soluble  the rice wine is more for taste and to help bring out the other flavonoids in the dishAfter  minutes add in the soy sauce and sugar Let that continue to cook down on mediumlow for a  minutes flipping the tofu to make sure both sides absorb the sauce So what youre looking for is the liquid to be about  reducedabsorbed into the tofu  This should take  minutes  Add in the soy sauce and sugar making sure the sugar dissolves into the liquid  Let that reduce and absorb into the tofu flipping to make sure both sides get that delicious liquidOnce the sauce is completely absorbed shut off the heat and mix in the green onion The green onion here is mostly for fragrance and color        Method  Strictly PanfryingCut firm tofu into large cm blocks gt Lightly oil a large skillet gt Add tofu turn heat to medium gt Brush a touch of oil on top side

the chili powder youll want one thats not overly fiery so the bog standard cayenne pepper from the bottle should work greatThat spice mix aboves one of the classic spice mixes used in Chinese BBQ Just add in a bit of anticaking agents and youve basically got what the street vendors useProcess  Street food style Tieban TofuGrind together the spice powder First grind together the star anise Sichuan peppercorns and cumin seeds Then add everything except the saltsugarMSG and grind again Finally add the saltsugarMSG and give it a final grind The reason the saltsugarMSG is added at the end is so that it doesnt cakeBrush the widest skillet you have with a thin layer of oil Less oil for this one because any oil bubbling over the topll muff up the layer of spice  thiss kinda mimicking Chinese BBQ dishes hereAdd the tofu to the pan brush on a top layer of oil and smother with the spice mix I know smother isnt really a proper amount but just use your own judgement Take a look at a picture of how much we addedhttpsiimgurcomdfkEUjpg if you need Fry the tofu for  minutes then rearrange if needed The street food vendors use a flat top so they can cook these nice and even For us on a stove rearranging halfway throughs a nice ideaFry for  minutes more and with a minute to go top with sliced scallionsOptionally chop into  cm cubes Thiss the way theyll often do it on the street then toss it in a bit of a plastic cup then eat with disposable chopsticksMethod  Strictly DeepFryingWith deepfrying it can often be nice to use a softer tofu The outside of the tofull form a nice crust while the moisture on the inside will evaporate and cause the tofu to puff upNote that this is not how they make tofu puffs  tofu puffs are made using a very firm mix of  beans to water but then including agents like ammonium carbonate borax and baking soda in the soy milk blend However if you search online in Chinese for DIY tofu puffs theyll often erroneously IMHO use deep fried soft tofu as a base High level overviewCut tofu into  cm triangles gt Add to oil at C over max flame gt Temp should lower to C gt Allow tofu to form and float gt Break apart any stuck pieces gt Lower flame to mediumlow fry at C for eight minutes Ingredients Puning TofuOk so this specific dish Puning tofu traditionally uses its own special tofu product here also called Puning tofu What Puning tofu is is a soft nigari tofu where the soy milk has some sweet potato starch mixed in then the tofu pieces are individually pressed and cut in half before fryingYou know how I just said that soft tofu puffs up really nice when deepfrying Yeah it also loves to collapse after In an average batch of deepfried tofu youll likely have  collapse on you its fine still tasty but way less easy on the eyes The starch in Puning tofu meanwhile allows it to maintain that puffy appearance Where I live in Shenzhen sometimes we see restaurants make this exact sub  soft tofu for Puning tofu  if they have sourcing problems with the latter as a city with a bunch of Teochew migrants the Puning tofu usually runs out at our local market by am Still works So if you happen to find Puning tofu use that otherwise dont hesitate to reach for soft Puning tofu or soft tofu g Oil  cups For frying Peanuts nice Two cups is if you use a round bottomed wok for deep frying Heavily recommended youll need way less oil in a wok If using a Dutch oven use like the  gallons of oil or whatever you need to actually fill that up proper s if it needed to be saidFor the sauce g Chinese chives   tsp salt optional  tsp fish sauce   cup water Fish sauce is a thing in Teochew dipping sauces I swearProcess Puning TofuCut the tofu into triangles If actually using Puning tofu just cut those little blocks in halfIn a wok heat the oil up until C then drop in the tofu slices For best results Id suggest no more than ten slices at a time else you could start to flirt with crowdingContinue over max flame until the tofu slices begin to float  minutes Once you drop the tofu slices in itll likely lower the temperature to C Thats fine The tofull also start to stick slightly also totally normal just let it form and gently break them apart with chopsticks Lower the flame to mediumlow fry for  minutes at C Or until puffy golden brown and the exterior begins to slightly break down Flip periodicallyRemove the tofu pieces lay on a papertowel

230,ca8l8e,What are your favorite breakfast meal-preps?,"Today I made a really delicious breakfast meal prep. I haven't really looked much in to meal prepping but I am in recovery from anorexia and bulimia so I've decided it's a good thing to do. 

Sometimes it takes me hours to decide what to eat, or I become so ravenous that I begin binging and than purging, so I've taken steps to be proactive. I wish I had more meal support. I have breakfast with someone about 4-5 days per week and dinner with someone about 5 times per week Lunches are kind of hard to do alone so it's been recommended that I make just a bit extra of dinner so I have something prepared, or I make sandwiches/paninis. 

Cooking is something that is very important to me and my family, as we all feel better eating foods prepared ourselves, and for me, eating highly processed foods is a recipe for binging and purging. My mom is also trying to lower her blood pressure and reduce the amount of money she spends on takeout while at work, so overall, eating balanced is important to us. 

Today I made a breakfast meal prep of a coconut baked oatmeal- I prepared an 8x8 dish and spread a layer of fresh strawberries and blueberries on the bottom, than I mixed together 2 c Oats, 1 tsp Baking Powder, 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 c of coconut flakes, and a pinch of salt. Than I made a custard of coconut milk, one egg, maple syrup, butter, and vanilla - then combined it all. I poured it over the berries and topped with some more coconut flakes and a few spoons of brown sugar (I bet coconut sugar or raw sugar would be amazing, but I used what we had). Baked it for an hour at 350 and broiled the top like a crisp for a minute. My mom brought it to work with some yogurt and sugar packs to go with it, and I had mine with some vanilla yogurt, slivered almonds and cashews, and a drizzle of honey (although it didn't need it. It was sweet enough for my tastes). It was really good and satiating, without leaving me feeling sluggish. I think it would be a real help to gather some more breakfast prep recipes, so that I don't have to stress myself out in the mornings. A few times per week we do a nice family breakfast with something fancier, but sometimes I just need something easy and nutritious. 

I'd appreciate any NUT FREE (peanut and tree nut) recipes since my mother is allergic to all peanuts and tree nuts, and I am allergic to walnuts. As I mentioned, I topped my bowl with slivered almonds and cashews, and I drink cashew milk on the regular, but I'd prefer to have something family friendly and we can customize as we see fit. :) Thank you so much!

For the last 30 mins, I put them bone-side down and put a layer of BBQ sauce on top. They tasted great and were done perfectly. However, what bothered me was how firm the meat was. It was super firm and they were miles away from the ""so soft you can pull out each bone by hand "" stage that I had optimistically envisioned.

I've heard boiling them before putting them on the grill softens them, but I wanted to ask whether anyone has tips on how to get them soft(er)?

245,ca906v,Tangy Marinara sauce,"So Marinara sauce is supposed to be one of the simplest tomato sauces to make. The base of pasta sauce. But for me, it has a special place as a dip for Mozzarella or topping for Parmesan encrusted chicken. This is one of the last sauces I still buy from a jar because I can't nail it down.

The problem is, all of the recipes online seem to be making some type of pasta sauce, not even close to the simple, tangy stuff from a jar at the supermarket.

First, the recipes are everywhere. The first few I tried used Basil, Oregano, and Parley in small amounts, which just ends up being pasta sauce to me, then throws in Grated Parmesan cheese, which takes away any ""tangyness"" the parsley would have added, then add either wine or vinegar, which while adds some tang, it isn't the same as what I am looking for. Oh, and a couple of these crazy folks added Worcestershire sauce to the mix. Not terrible, but not Marinara, at least not what I am used to.

Next we have the chunk of recipes that uses lots of parsley, salt, and a dash of oregano. These just end up tasting like Chef Boyardee pizza sauce. I like it, but again, not what I am looking for.

Last group of recipes is most simple. Simmer garlic bits in olive oil, throw in tomato sauce, add basil and oregano. This tastes like the blandest pasta sauce one could make. No tang. Certainly not what I was hoping for.

So after about 10 different attempts at this, I am hoping for some direction from someone other than random bloggers that SEO'd themselves to the first few pages of a Google search.

285,c9uvfa,"Mushroom and rice soup (homemade, vegan)"," 

Mushroom and Rice Soup

I had been mulling this over in my head for several days and finally got a chance to buy a bunch of mushrooms, about a pound or so of crimini  and about half that of shiitake. My rice was cooked and in the fridge, so I made it. This is all off the top of my head.

2-3 TBSP oil

½ red onion, diced

2 medium carrots, diced

1 stalk celery (optional, I never have it in the house)

3 cloves garlic, minced

1 serrano pepper, deseeded and diced

1 tsp or so herbs de Provence (or whatever dry herbs you prefer)

About a pound of any mushrooms, sliced

Splash of red wine to deglaze

4 quarts vegetable stock (or any kind)

2 cups (or more additional water)

2 cups pre-cooked rice (I had basmati) 

Splash of apple cider vinegar

Splash of soy sauce

Salt and pepper to taste

In a large pot, heat oil. Add the onions and carrots and saute until the onions are well cooked and maybe a little color on them. In the meantime chop up the mushrooms. Add the garlic and pepper and let them turn fragrant (careful the pepper steam can get in your eyes). Add the herbs and mix them in and let them become fragrant. Put the mushrooms in the pot and stir. Stirring occasionally, cook them until they have all released their juices and cooked down. Add the wine and cook it down until it is almost gone. Add the stock and rice and stir well. Add enough water to get everything well mixed. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. I let it simmer for about 30 minutes, then tasted it and it needed help. A few turns on the pepper mill and a dollop of salt helped. I then splashed in the vinegar and soy sauce, stirred and let them simmer in before tasting again. 

The soup is somewhat spicy, so if you don’t like spice leave the pepper out. You can always add some other seasoning later. The soup will suck water up and turn into a stew if you let it. Just add water to make it more soup-like. As made it is vegan but not gluten free.

286,c9r4jk,Planning a fermentation food science lab with 48-72 hour lead time?,"I'm a Science teacher. 

I have been studying respiration with my Year 7 (11-12 year old) pupils and we are about to move on to acids and alkalis before we break up for Summer.

I would like to do a food science lab. I have access to a full high school food technology lab and one of our technicians has a background in food tech, so there is quite a lot of potential here. I'm not sure what the best practical would be though. I'm after something that:

* The kids can set up themselves (e.g. shred and squeeze their own cabbage to make sauerkraut)
* We can leave to ferment then return to 48-72 hours later (depending on where in the fortnightly timetable I schedule the lessons) and see a clear visual/textural/taste/smell difference in the product, and measure a pH change using a common indicator (universal or methyl orange)
* Is low risk so the kids can take it home and eat/drink it
* Has very cheap ingredients and doesn't require the kids to supply any equipment other than an empty glass jar, etc. (my school is in a very deprived part of the city)

The finished product doesn't have to be ready within the 72 hours. As long as they can measure and observe a clear difference in that time period I can send them home for the holidays with a set of instructions on how to continue fermentation for further days or weeks if necessary.

I'm am experienced home cook myself, but I don't have much experience with fermentation beyond bread dough and yoghurt, neither of which are left for as long as two or three days.

Any tips would be much appreciated. Our technician has been off work or I would have asked her.

308,c96lxw,Soaking your own dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans) rather than using canned is a GENUINE revelation.,"Look, I going to say I consider myself a pretty competent home cook but I'm not going to claim to have the _most_ refined and rarified palate.

I bet a lot of people here are probably like me if you're honest - You've seen recipes saying that you really _must_ use soaked dried chickpeas rather than the canned ones and thought ""eh, well maybe for a special occasion or dinner party but an overnight soak and extra cooking time just for a weeknight dinner?"" Probably influenced by the times you've seen recipes insisting that you _must_ only use this particular bronze-extruded pasta, this particular brand of imported DOP tomatoes, or this vegetable _only_ when it's absolutely at the peak of being in season. And you've tried the fancy version, tried it with whatever you'd usually buy and thought ""well, the fancy one is _somewhat_ better but probably not better enough to merit the extra effort/expense every day"".

The other week though we made both some falafel and a chickpea curry using dried chickpeas which we soaked overnight and, even to my untrained palate, the difference was _vast_ and _immediately apparent_. In particular with the curry - We both try to cut back on meat and my partner goes through intermittent vegan/vegetarian periods so we've cooked a fair few chickpea curries over the years but we've both agreed that, no matter the recipe we've used, they've all had _something_ about them which has led to them tasting kinda the same in some way and, while not bad, not exactly great either. This, though, was the first chickpea curry I've ever had made at home which genuinely matched up to what I've ordered from good Indian restaurants.

Seriously try it if you haven't - soaking them overnight and potentially having to pre-cook them for an extra 30-40 minutes might seem like a lot of extra time but it's really all hands off time. Dump them in a bowl full of cold water and cover right before you go to bed or before you leave for work, drain them and dump them in a pan of simmering water as soon as you get in from work and they'll be ready by the time you want to start cooking, with no real hands on cooking required.",GenericUname,cooking,Soaking your own dried chickpeas garbanzo beans rather than using canned is a GENUINE revelation Look I going to say I consider myself a pretty competent home cook but Im not going to claim to have the most refined and rarified palateI bet a lot of people here are probably like me if youre honest  Youve seen recipes saying that you really must use soaked dried chickpeas rather than the canned ones and thought eh well maybe for a special occasion or dinner party but an overnight soak and extra cooking time just for a weeknight dinner Probably influenced by the times youve seen recipes insisting that you must only use this particular bronzeextruded pasta this particular brand of imported DOP tomatoes or this vegetable only when its absolutely at the peak of being in season And youve tried the fancy version tried it with whatever youd usually buy and thought well the fancy one is somewhat better but probably not better enough to merit the extra effortexpense every dayThe other week though we made both some falafel and a chickpea curry using dried chickpeas which we soaked overnight and even to my untrained palate the difference was vast and immediately apparent In particular with the curry  We both try to cut back on meat and my partner goes through intermittent veganvegetarian periods so weve cooked a fair few chickpea curries over the years but weve both agreed that no matter the recipe weve used theyve all had something about them which has led to them tasting kinda the same in some way and while not bad not exactly great either This though was the first chickpea curry Ive ever had made at home which genuinely matched up to what Ive ordered from good Indian restaurantsSeriously try it if you havent  soaking them overnight and potentially having to precook them for an extra  minutes might seem like a lot of extra time but its really all hands off time Dump them in a bowl full of cold water and cover right before you go to bed or before you leave for work drain them and dump them in a pan of simmering water as soon as you get in from work and theyll be ready by the time you want to start cooking with no real hands on cooking required,1

I have made is several times now (b/c soooo good) but only today did I take note of the quantities

**Balsamic Red Onion Lentils** (this makes enough as a side for multiple people or main for me + leftovers)

* Chop one medium red onion - divide in half
* In a large-ish saucepan, sautee half the onion (save the rest of the onion) in olive oil on medium heat, until soft - about 7 minutes. Do NOT add salt. 
* After onions are soft, add 1 1/2c of dried brown lentils and toss around in all your flavor. 
* Cover with water by about 1/2 an inch, cover pot, and bring to a boil. Notice there is still NO SALT. Remove lid and reduce to a heavy simmer and cook until they are *almost* cooked to your liking, and water is being cooked off
* When they are on the edge of cooked, drain off most of the excess liquid. Return to the pan over low heat. Add 1/2c olive oil, 1/2c balsamic vinegar, the other half of the onion, one smashed garlic clove (it's going to steep and be removed later), two heavy pinches of sugar, and generous amount of salt. Stir around, cover, and leave it alone for 15 minutes. 
* After 15 minutes, taste lentils for seasoning and remove the crushed garlic.

370,c9bzjr,I want to double down on Italian cuisine.,"(tl;dr), what I'm looking for is some online resources for really getting into it. I want to develop an Italian kitchen essentially.

Another way to put it is that im trying to find resources that, once I learn them, will enable me to just create a dish and have it be distinctly Italian.


Most often I find myself going for ""Italian"" whenever I cook something that isn't a specific recipe (ie, just pulling staples out of my pantry/fridge). And what I mean by Italian is mostly just keeping it fresh, simplistic, a bit rustic, and definitely balanced. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've dabbled in other cuisines. I grew up generally knowing American recipes, and I explored a lot of French and Japanese style recipes when I started cooking, but nowadays the sort of ""Italian"" style is just what I like, and its what I gravitate towards whenever I just need to get food into me. (Short of breakfast; breakfast for me is never any better than American style breakfast)   


I've made my own pasta before and intend to do so again after I work through some more of the dried stuff I bought (still building up my kitchen as it is), and I'm pretty good at getting a well balanced dish no matter what it is I'm cooking. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm good at that I identify as specifically Italian is your basic pasta dishes (Carbonara, Aglio e Olio, different gnocchis, different shaped pastas like tortellini etc) and then just meats and vegetables that are simply saute'd. I also really love infusing different spices and herbs wherever I can, though some (like cardamom I think) don't seem to always be that prevalent in Italian. I also love any excuse to use wine for something.   


But things I've never tried is the classic red sauce. I've done white sauces, but I tend to not like them as they get too heavy (I'm also pretty sure most white sauces aren't even Italian anyway). Never done pizza. Seafood I've done in the past, but I haven't worked with it in some time, so I'm unsure of where to go with it.

374,c98d3a,Grasshopper pie help,"So I'm making a Grasshopper pie. I am on mobile so it's tough finding my exact recipe. [Here](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/grasshopper-pie-2651742) is an example pretty close to what I'm going for. 

I have made it once and came into one issue. I create the pie core by melting marshmallows with half and half. Very slowly. I pour the mixture into a bowl surrounded by an ice bath. After cooling, I then add creme de menthe and creme DE cacao. This is where I ran into problems.

After adding the liqueurs I then tried to fold them into the marshmallow goop. My goop broke into solid pieces instead of retaining it's shape. So I ended up having to whisk it together then fold in the whipped cream. I think because I had to whisk the marshmallow batter the pie lacked peaks one might expect.

Questions:

* should I have let the marshmallow mixture cool further? 

This is my first suspicion.

* Did I use too many marshmallows/not enough half and half? 

This is my second suspicion. The mixture was too solid to begin with so it was always going to break up.

* Is this simply suppose to happen?

Maybe I'm overthinking this and I am simply meant to destroy the marshmallow form. It turned out fine. Tasted great. Very much a smooth and light pie.

401,c8ytnv,Made a big oopsie in making crepes,"Hi there. I recently became interested in cooking crepes a couple of days ago when my aunt came over, made the batter then fobbed all the work of actually cooking them onto me. They tasted nice.

Now, yesterday I think to myself ""hey, I've got some free time. I'm gonna try this cookimg crepes lark again,"" realised that I had everything in the house necessary, except milk. So, I head out, buy the milk, fall asleep, planning to make the batter ij the evening and keeping it overnight in the fridge. Keeping in mind that I'm a teenager who's never been trusted in the kitchen and therefore have little to no experience cooking, I made most of the batter. I put the flour, milk, water, salt and butter in the blender and blended, realised I had forgot the egg, then, as I go to fetch them, realise, they're not there. My brother used the two remain ing eggs in the fridge to make an Omelette while I was asleep.
Yes, i realise. A mentally competent person would have set out the ingredients in front of them before starting the recette. Accept that I am not mentally competent.

At the time, it is now midnight. I can't go out and buy eggs. I have a crepe batter minus the eggs in front of me. I put it in the fridge to rest. If I add the eggs in the morning belatedly will the batter still give good crepe? Or should I just beg my mum for money to replenish the ingredients and start afresh? I don't mind a subpar crepe, as long as it is edible. But I also dont want to go to the effort of making these crepes only to find out, they cannot be eaten.

Update:

Crepes were Tasty! A success! I added the eggs, blended once more and gave it another twenty minutes to rest before cooking. They were mostly somewhat wonky, because I will not lie and say I'm actually anu good at cooking. My mother gives them a very honest 7/10, my brother givest them 2/10 because he expected sweet pancakes, but that is his perogative.

425,c8wius,Have I been dumb by having a sheet of aluminum on the bottom rack of a 2 rack oven?,"At the risk of outing myself as dumb - I just moved into a new apartment, and I went to cook a frozen pizza.  Normally I place those directly on the rack, but since it looked like some toppings might fall off once cooked I put a layer of foil on the lower rack beneath the pizza to catch them.

When the pizza was done cooking, it was very mushy and with next to no crisp.  I tried it again a week later, with a different brand and style of pizza thinking that was the issue, and again, same thing.  Today I tried reverse searing a relatively thin steak and it took forever, and then realized the foil was still there.  So my question is - did that layer of aluminum prevent the heat from getting to where it needed to go?  My theory is that since aluminum doesn't really hold heat long, it acted like a shield to the food instead of actually being useful.  Does that hold any weight?",TantalSplurge,cooking,Have I been dumb by having a sheet of aluminum on the bottom rack of a  rack oven At the risk of outing myself as dumb  I just moved into a new apartment and I went to cook a frozen pizza  Normally I place those directly on the rack but since it looked like some toppings might fall off once cooked I put a layer of foil on the lower rack beneath the pizza to catch themWhen the pizza was done cooking it was very mushy and with next to no crisp  I tried it again a week later with a different brand and style of pizza thinking that was the issue and again same thing  Today I tried reverse searing a relatively thin steak and it took forever and then realized the foil was still there  So my question is  did that layer of aluminum prevent the heat from getting to where it needed to go  My theory is that since aluminum doesnt really hold heat long it acted like a shield to the food instead of actually being useful  Does that hold any weight,1

Please don’t include any of the following ingredients eggs, dairy, red-meat, soy, gluten, oils.   I’ve recently discovered  that I need to avoid these foods due to two medical conditions (EOE, and Alpha-Gal allergy.). I’m a new cook trying to stay healthy with all these food restrictions.  I’ve included many of the ingredients to get needed nutrients like calcium (greens), potassium (potatoes), iodine (dulse) etc. on this restrictive diet.  I batch cook and refrigerate this to eat over the course of 4 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients:

10 cups freshly made chicken broth  (including diced mirepoix)

10 oz dried lentils

1.5 lb cubed red potatoes

1.5 lb cubed sweet potatoes

160 grams basmati rice

25 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes

8 oz sliced mushrooms

16 oz bag mustard greens (or collards/turnip greens)

1 finely diced  serrano pepper

5 tsp dulse flakes

&amp;#x200B;

Spices:

2 tsp dried thyme

2 tsp dried rosemary

1 tsp smoked paprika

0.75 tsp cayenne pepper

Black pepper (70 grinds.  don't know tsp amount)

0.5 tsp turmeric

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Throw in everything except the rice, greens, tomatoes into a large stock pot.
* Set induction cooktop to high and set timer for 70 minutes.
* Wait for boiling  and bring temp down till there is a fast simmer/slow boil and cover pot.
* With 40 minutes left throw in the greens and increase temperature.
* Once greens wilt and soup is boiling, bring back down to simmer and cover.
* Throw in rice with 25 minutes left.
* Throw in tomatoes with 10 minutes left.  (I heard it’s best not to add until lentils are soft)

The dish is alright but hoping it could be improved a bit.

[Beka's Spaghetti O Bonanza]

Ingredients:

· 1 Can of Spaghetti O's w/ Franks

· Splash of 2% Milk

· 1/2 Tsp Butter

· 1/4 Tsp Garlic Powder

· Dash Black Pepper

· Dash Hot Sauce

· Handful of Cheese Doritos

 Cook the Spaghetti O's w/ Franks in a saucepan on medium heat and add in butter, 2% milk, garlic powder, black pepper, and hot sauce. Cook until hot. Serve in a deep bowl with Doritos on the side and dip Doritos in and scoop the spaghetti o's out with them like a dipping sauce. Ha-ha told you it wasn't gourmet or really a recipe parse but it's definitely a fun way to make spaghetti o's a nice little snack after school.

485,c8l3le,Looking for the perfect all-in-one app for the home cook (Android/Windows),"I am looking for a mobile or windows app that would help me organize my recipes. But I also want to track and manage everything food-related in it, since that's way more convenient and saves time. So, here's the list of features I need:

&amp;#x200B;

**Must have features:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Recipe management:**

\- list of ingredients

\- cooking instructions

**2. Ingredient management:**

\- can add your own ingredients to the list of available ingredients

**3. Macronutrient calculation:**

\- can set macronutrient values of ingredients

\- can either track foods eaten (full-fledged calorie tracker), or put together meals from recipes to give a total macronutrient output of a meal (like, I add 2 servings this recipe, 100g this recipe, and 50g this ingredient, and see macronutrient totals for them all, so I can then put it in my calorie tracker app)

\- can set ingredient loss percentage in recipes (like, marinating meat in fatty liquid, most of which is then discarded and thus should not count for the macronutrient value of the fried meat serving)

\- can set macronutrient loss in recipes or manually adjust resulting values (like, I'm cooking low fat cheese from milk and cottage cheese, where I discard whey at one point, and thus some carbs and proteins are removed)

**4. Recipe cost calculation:**

\- can set prices of ingredients

\- can see a price of a certain meal (like, 1 serving of this recipe will cost $100 to make, since it uses 100g of $500/kg ingredient and 200g of $250/kg ingredient)

**5. Meal planning:**

\- can assign recipes to certain dates/times

**6. Export:**

\- can save my data in some format that will let me retain it outside of the app should the app die in one way or the other (like, online database explodes or my account is erased or whatever)

&amp;#x200B;

**Desired features:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Import recipes from popular websites**

**2. OCR**

**3. Shopping list**

**4. Automated sync across devices** (so my wife can install it and see what's planned for dinner)

**5. Convenient management of flexible recipes** (like, sweet and sour chicken/pork/fish which can have 5 versions of sweet and sour sauce and 5 versions of batters and 5 versions of vegetable sides, or eclairs which can have 10 different fillings and 5 different toppings)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone already using an app that does just that, by chance?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  

To whoever finds this post:

I  have done the search myself and found that there is no such app already  made. The best app there is that fits is MyNetDiary, but it starts to  become laggy when you add many recipes to it, it cannot calculate  ingredient loss percentage, it cannot calculate price (I used a hack  where I used trans-fats as price, since I don't eat foods with trans  fats in them, but still, it's not a feature) and is clunky to use when  you manage modular recipes. But it's the best there is for managing both  a recipe book and nutrition.

I am now  exploring creating my own database in an app like Mobi DB. This allows  you to make any database you want, including the one I need, but it will  take time, a lot of time, to create the database (develop all the rules  - like, teaspoon to tablespoon conversions, nutrition formulae etc.).

547,c7y0zo,What went wrong with my chorizo burgers?,"I made (Mexican) chorizo for the first time last week. I used a pork butt that I ground, and a recipe I got from a coworker. The flavor was spot on, but the burgers were falling apart on the grill, and really the only thing that held them together on the spatula was the thick slice of cheese I melted on top. Below are a few thoughts I had, and I'm curious if any single one is the culprit, or a combination...

The recipe I used had a spice blend mixed in the meat, and some white vinegar. And it further stated to let it sit in the fridge overnight before cooking with it. The next day, as you can imagine, there was a lot of liquid in the bowl with the meat, obviously the vinegar and juices pulled out of the meat from the seasoning. I mixed these juices back into the meat, which resulted in a very wet mix. Should I have discarded the juices instead of mixing back into the meat?

Or...is it just hard to make chorizo burgers with just chorizo? Should I have mixed some beef in the burgers as a binder of sorts? Along with this point, while the burgers tasted phenomenal, they were a little too rich, if that makes sense. It was tough to finish an entire burger. Could this also be mitigated by working in some ground beef?

548,c812wa,Beginner need help on eggs sticking on pan.,"Hi, I've just started to learn cooking via YouTube. Mainly via Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver. 


Official cooking experience: 2 days. 

OK. So I was trying to cook scramble eggs and the remnants of it actually got stucked quite badly on my pan, which require strong dishwasher to remove it. Any methods to prevent it from happening?

Firstly, here's a picture of my scramble eggs. https://imgur.com/a/6aHLqa5

Do let me know if it looks okay or bad.

I felt that it is slightly overcooked as I encounter eggs sticking onto the pan problem which delay me from pouring them out properly.

So here's how I cook it.

1. Heat the pan (around medium heat). And whisk 5 eggs (I used to eat 5 soft boiled eggs for breakfast) 

2. Add a tablespoon of butter into the pan and let it sizzle a little. About half melted. 

3. Pour in the eggs.

4. Slowly push the eggs into the middle from all corners. And keep repeating it. 

5. When I start to realised that the eggs were beginning to stick onto the pan, I started to just really scramble it all around while adjusting the flame lower and even turn off the flame at one point to control the heat/ cooking process.

6. After scrambling around, I then served it as per the image, with egg remnants sticking all around my pan. 


P.S. Side topic, is my poached egg alright?
I did trimmed off the sides a bit though.

I am going to choose my words *extremely* carefully. Because if you want a shit storm bring up knives.

I'm a pocket knife enthusiast. Many of these little knives use super steels unknown to kitchens. I like good steel. I understand if you do too. There is *nothing* wrong with choosing to own good stuff.

However, many expensive knives are heavy, use thick blade stock and are difficult to sharpen without the right tools or an investment of time.

First: Heavy. Sure that heavy blade feels good in the hand (heavy = quality, right?) The truth is thick blade stock splits rather than cuts or slices (much like splitting a log vs. slicing a thin piece off). The heavier and thicker it is the more tiring it is to use as well.

Second: The longer it keeps an edge the harder it is to sharpen. Many expensive knives are made of hard steels that keep an edge, but when it comes time to sharpen them unless you have the tools and patience you'll have an expensive, dull knife.

Knife honing steels are very useful, but they do not sharpen knives. They remove burrs, help straighten the edges but they are very imprecise. A honing steel can help maintain an edge, but when it comes time to sharpen you need precise tools.

Some folks can free-hand sharpen a knife with an Arkansas stone or a diamond embedded stone. They can, the vast majority of us cannot and will make the knives duller. I say this from experience. My great uncle can make a Case knife so sharp it will cut you if you look at it wrong. Even after years of trying I cannot.

To truly sharpen these expensive, tough knives you need precise sharpening equipment like a Lansky Sharpener, which uses specific rods, angles, etc. It will take about 10 minutes to set up and another 10-20 minutes to sharpen your knife. One at a time.

Be honest and ask yourself: are you willing to do that? Are you willing to buy the sharpening equipment, learn how to use it and use it once or twice a month before simply dicing an onion?

I'm not. When my Dexter is a little dull I spend 30 seconds with a hand sharpener and I'm off to the races, slicing and dicing like a madman.

Bottom line: Want an expensive knife, buy it. It will last longer than a cheap Dexter knife (but a Dexter will easily last for decades). Just know you're going to spend money and time to keep it sharp. If you're willing to accept that ignore me all to hell and keep on sharpening and chopping.

If you're like me, get a Dexter (or Victorinox, or whatever) whip it through a hand sharpener, dice what you need and get cooking.

Today I had no appetite but knew I needed a snack before heading out, saw I had some pita chips, and lots of fresh veggies, so I looked up some cold veggie dip recipes and whipped one up in minutes! I used

1 c Mayo
1/2 c Sour Craam
1 Tablespoon Dried Parsley
1 Tablespoon Dried Chives
1/2 tsp Dried Tarragon
1/2 tsp Dried Dill
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
1/4 tsp Minced Onion (Dried)
Salt and Pepper 

Mixed it all up and had myself a little snacking plate with fresh veggies, pretzels, and little ham/cheddar rollups. The dip was so good. After work my mom and I dug in again and let's just say there is no more dip and I need to make more!

Lately I have been picnicking a lot and relying on these sorts of snacky foods to keep up throughout the day, I am interested in more dip recipes. What are some of your favorites? Anything cold, refreshing, make ahead! And of course tell me whatcha like to dip in it too. :) Thanks so much!

609,c7l0wr,Ways to add smokiness to a burger?,"Have been developing a burger recipe over the last few months and I'm pretty satisfied with what I have so far. This is what I've got:

-1/4 lb. smashed patty, salted and peppered, either a beef blend or bison depending on mood

-mild cheddar

-deep caramelized yellow onions (salt, balsamic, honey, thyme... and time)

-lotta lactofermented deli pickle slices

-dijon mustard

-all atop a Portuguese-style sesame seed bun toasted in EVOO

-best served with the juiciest New England style IPA one can find

So I like all of the flavors in the dish so far. I've got the savoriness of the meat, the fat/acid balance with the cheese and the pickles, some sweetness with the onion, some nose-clearing heat with the dijon, and the bitterness and carbonation from the IPA to cut the richness.

The one thing I'm missing is that deep underlying smokiness.  I'm cooking indoors so no charcoal grill, I've tried adding liquid smoke to the onions but I get a kind of KC-style BBQ flavor that is OK but not exactly what I want. I've considered adding some sort of peaty/smoky whiskey but I'm not sure how it'll turn out.

626,c7c234,Finally invested in a digital stand thermometer...,"... and I think it's changed my cooking life forever.

I've used analog handheld thermometers before and have a couple in my drawer, but I've never been able to use them effectively. Today I wanted to make fried chicken and wanted to do it right, so I ventured off to the shops and bought myself a Salter digital thermometer.

It was amazing. Previously I would have over cooked breading on my chicken and raw chicken inside. Or I would have too oily chicken that is over cooked inside. Tonight I had crispy chicken breading and moist, delicious chicken meat. I had a moment, standing in my kitchen, eating into the delicious chicken and I almost teared up in happiness.

Moral of the story? Stop waiting and go and get one yourself!

627,c7dxj4,Food Safety and procedures in the kitchen,"I hope this is the right place. If not I'd love to know a good place to post it.

I have a friend that seems to really misunderstand safety of food. I actually avoid eating stuff they make if they bring it to a party or something or if they cook otherwise.

They seem to do everything wrong (in my opinion) and I wanted to know if there is a nice document on standards for handling things in the kitchen that is rather convincing I could send them.

The kinds of things they do are:

Washing hands at anytime is completely out of the question. Counter is never wiped properly always has a discussing film. Of course it's perfectly fine to leave a wooden spoon on that and then use it to stir food on the stove. Then why not leave the food overnight. Then re-heat it to eat some 24h later. Leave it in the fridge for a week and a half, then freeze it for later. She gets the shits all the time and she is constantly taking imodium to be able to leave the house. Dishes are never very well cleaned and there is always food in the utensil trays and drying area for the dishes. The frame that holds the drying dishes has a film of food/grunge on it. Food is always rotting in the fridge. There is always a pot of food on the counter that is up to a week and a half (or even more old). She doesn't wash vegetables or washes them poorly. Her own dog shits right next to the kitchen (rather than the usual convention of bringing the dog out side). Of course the dog trots their shit all over the house. Dishes are usually left around. Often in a sink full of water and food for days. Even a week. She'll wash dishes in water that's been sitting for 5 days and just put them out to dry without rinsing them with fresh water at all. The concept of cross contamination is lost too. Why not stick a fork into some raw chicken then use it to sample something later. She will open something (perhaps a processed ham or something), eat a small bit and then just leave it in the fridge thinking it's good forever.  

Thankfully most of her cooking consists of pouring something out of a box or can and heating. That stuff is so laced with salt that it's a bit more tolerant (likely). If meat is involved it's usually overcooked which probably helps.

Needless to say when I go to walk their dog and other volunteer activities I don't eat there. :)

I've brought this up and she's pretty uneducated and doesn't really find my claim that her procedures are the reason she always has the shits and other health issues. So I'm looking for some sort of step by step list or procedures for running a kitchen to show her.

I was just on the phone with her and found out she is bringing some spaghetti sauce to a party tonight. I was able to discover that she cooked it partially yesterday and had left it out over night so she can cook it the rest of the way just before the party tonight (in another 7 hours or so). It will be like 30 hours out of the fridge for something containing ground beef... Not that I eat her stuff but I often ask her about the details when she is bringing stuff. She sometimes tells me and I believe she sometimes will lie to me because she thinks my idea that food needs a bit more respect are not founded.

Anyway any particular documents/web sites that might be a good starting point to send her to?

I'm astoundingly well-prep'd for tacos – real, good, authentic, insane tacos – but was just looking for other people's opinions. I'm well versed with many tasty foodstuffs, honestly; been a hoppin' chef from place to place for the past 5 years. 

There's a lot that can be done with taco ingredients, tho, so that's my default that's def. gonna be a main. But I want to keep it simple and effective. So, yeah! If anyone's on the same page as I, don't hesitate to reach out, post, lemme know!

672,c76uca,Simmering versus Boiling,"So as you can probably tell from the title I've been trying to figure out how to simmer in order to make some boneless pork ribs stovetop (oven is broken otherwise I probably would've taken the easy way out). The recipe I've used essentially sears the ribs before turning the heat down to simmer the ribs in BBQ sauce for roughly 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

However, every single time I've tried this my ribs turn out dry and pretty unappetizing. I've been trying to figure out if this is due to incorrect simmering technique (I am using an electric stove so controlling the heat is annoying sometimes), or if I'm doing something wrong (ex making a BBQ sauce thats too watery).

&amp;#x200B;

Exact process I've been using:

Season the ribs (salt and pepper)

Sear the ribs for about a minute per side

Bring down the heat and pour in about half a cup of water, and cover the rest of the ribs with BBQ sauce (I'm always worried I'll burn the sauce and have to scrape things off the pan)

681,c75mkk,Panna Cotta - low cal / keto suggestions,"Yesterday I was at a Roman restaurant and I had their panna cotta.  I enjoyed it and thought ""I could make this!!""  

Here's what I tried for my first experimental batch.

1/3 cup half and half
2/3 cup cream

I mixed in a sauce pot and put on low heat.

I gradually mixed in a blend of Splenda and sugar to taste.  

I have a batch of sugar that I keep spent vanilla pods in, so I used that sugar.

I also scraped in some vanilla to the mix of cream and half and half.  I added a little bit of almond extract.

After it had been cooking a while, I mixed in 1 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin.  

I continued heating for a while, and then put this into a ramekin, covered in plastic wrap, and stuck it in the fridge

PROBLEMS:

A lot of the vanilla particles settled to the bottom of the container.  Does anyone know how restaurants get the vanilla to mix evenly through the panna cotta?

What flavors have people tried?  A lot of classic recipes tend to just use fruit.  I was thinking I could get some good caramel and make a layered dish.

The Splenda seemed to be okay for sweetener.  I was going to try Swerve next to see about making it keto.

Then, for a keto version the fruit wouldn't be best, but the vanilla would still work.  Maybe blueberry?

692,c72eez,New Reddit chef/cook here! (Foodtruck help/advice),"(NYC)

By new, I mean to reddit! 

So I'm starting up a food truck in my area in the coming year. Was just wondering if you guys have any recommendations for easy-peas-y meals I can prepare for my local folk. I'm astoundingly well-prep'd for tacos – real, good, authentic, insane tacos – but was just looking for other people's opinions. I'm well versed with many tasty foodstuffs, honestly; been a hoppin' chef from place to place for the past 5 years. 

There's a lot that can be done with taco ingredients, tho, so that's my default that's def. gonna be a main. But I want to keep it simple and effective. So, yeah! If anyone's on the same page as I, don't hesitate to reach out, post, lemme know!

728,c6jku3,Stir Fry - avoiding burning / smoking brown sugar?,"This is a really basic question but I haven't been able to figure out the solution to it yet - when you're making a stir fry with brown sugar in the marinade, how do you avoid smoking yourself out of the house? The last two times I made stir fry and marinaded the chicken in a sauce that contained brown sugar, the minute it hit the pan, it turned my kitchen into a smokehouse forcing me to open all the windows and have a fan blowing outside.

If you're a fan of simple or classic recipes, turn back now - this is the epitome of rich, decadent, and probably a bit overly-complicated. But after having this I can't go back to normal stuffing. I'm not 100% sure if this recipe can be found on the internet (I used to know of one link which has since been broken/taken down), so here's a photo of the newspaper clipping:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6TZ_OQhTGPwUkFVT0wteW5tNG8/view?usp=sharing

This recipe is actually for a turkey *and* the stuffing, and it calls for a garlic/herb/oil mixture that is used for both. If you're doing a turkey separately your own way, you can downsize the portions it calls for when making the roasted garlic/herb/oil rub. I've already made those adjustments in the recipe below:

**Forest Mushroom and Salami Stuffing**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 Head Garlic, cloves separated and peeled
* 1/4 cup vegetable/canola oil
* 1 sprig Rosemary, leaves only, minced
* 1 sprig Marjoram or Oregano, leaves only
* 1 sprig Thyme, leaves only
* 1oz dried Porcini Mushrooms
* 3 cups Chicken/Turkey Broth
* 8oz sliced Genoa Salami, finely chopped
* 1 large Yellow Onion, diced
* 1 stalk Celery, diced
* 1/4 cup chopped Shallot
* 1lb fresh mixed Mushrooms (Trumpet, Oyster, Crimini, Shiitake, Maitake, Morel, etc.), sliced
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1/2 tsp ground Black Pepper
* 14oz can quartered Artichoke Hearts, roughly chopped
* 8oz Fontina Cheese, grated, divided
* 2 Eggs, beaten
* 1 loaf stale Country Bread, cubed and toasted (~8 cups)

**Directions:**

1. Make the roasted garlic and herb oil: Preheat oven to 350F. Place the garlic and oil in a small baking dish/ramekin. Ensure that the oil covers all of the cloves. Cover pan with foal and roast for 1.5 hours or until garlic is very soft and golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
2. Once the garlic has cooled, drain and reserve the oil.
3. Combine roasted garlic, rosemary, marjoram/oregano, and thyme in a food processor. Process until smooth.
4. Coat a **large** casserole dish or 9""x13"" baking ban with butter or cooking spray.
5. In a medium sauce pan over high heat, combine the Porcini mushrooms and broth. Bring to a boil, and remove the skillet from heat and allow to cool.
6. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the reserved 1/4 cup of garlic oil. Add the salami and saute until crisped and browned, about 8-10 minutes. Add the onion, celery, and shallot and continue to cook until the onion is soft and translucent.
7. Add the sliced mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook until the mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.
8. Remove the saute pan from heat and stir in the reserved garlic/herb puree, Porcini/broth mixture, artichoke hearts, 3/4 of the grated Fontina, and the eggs. Add the bread cubes, toss well, then spoon into the greased casserole dish. Top with the remaining Fontina and bake for 35 to 45 minutes.

3,cwzeb7,"Recipe: Macao Minchi, a Ground Meat Stir Fry (免治肉粒饭)","So today, I wanted to teach you how to make Macanese Minchi. It’s one of the most iconic dishes in Macao, and really emblematic of Macanese food in general.

What’s Macanese food? That’s… a whole can of worms. The food in Macao generally falls into one of three categories – Cantonese (there’s some great Cantonese food in Macao), Portuguese, and Macanese – i.e. the food of the Macanese people. The Macanese people, meanwhile, can sort of be thought of as a mix of Portuguese and Cantonese… but that simplification hides a much more convoluted tale. I won’t pretend to be an expert here – I’m certainly no ethnographer – but I’d highly recommend wikisurfing the topic if you’re so inclined. 

Macanese food, meanwhile, is… fascinating. It’s a *true* mix of Western and Cantonese foods – a real mind fuck in the best possible way. On the menu? Stuff like “Diabo” – a stew with a bunch of different leftover banquet meats (e.g. Char Siu, Siu Yuk, Brisket) together with tomato, potato, egg, and Cantonese sour pickles. Tacho (a.k.a. ""Gweilo Buddha Jumps over the Wall"") – a stew with a similar mix of ingredients, plus shrimp paste and Cauliflower. African chicken – a milder Piri Piri chicken with an obvious Goan influence. Spinach Paste – Western-style stewed spinach with garlic and shrimp paste. And that shrimp paste? It’s called Balichao… which’s Macao’s own slightly Western-style take on Cantonese-style shrimp paste.

And of course, Minchi. From everything I can tell, word ‘minchi’ itself seems to be derived from the English work “mince”, although I still haven’t been able to get a reliable source on the topic. But it *does* communicate the essence of the dish – it’s… stir-fried mince meat.

There’s a mind boggling amount of Minchi variations… it’s one of those dishes where every family seems to have their own way of doing it. This version is pretty close to how you’d get it if you ate at a Macanese restaurant in Macao - it’s some marinated minced meat fried with sausage, onion, and bay leaf… served with fried potatoes, laid over a bed of white rice, and - in that ever-so-Portugese way - topped with a fried egg.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/z6HwqDBP2Y4).

**Ingredients:**

1.	*Pork Leg (后腿肉), 250g -and- Beef Chuck (牛肩肉), 250g; Both 80/20; Minced.* So right. We’ll be hand-mincing these guys, but if you have your own meat grinder feel free to use that too. A food processor might end up a touch on the pasty side, but would still be an acceptable solution. If you’ve got a real butcher, they’ll grind it for you too, of course. Just try not to use the standard supermarket ground beef. Why? Put simply… that stuff is… bad. It barely makes for an acceptable burger, and here we don’t have cheese and a whole bunch of fixings to hide the mince under. The mince’s the star of the show here, so it should be a proper mince – not the sad, discolored, shrink-wrapped stuff that you find at most supermarkets in the West.  

2.	*Marinade for the meat: 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp white wine (白葡萄酒), ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper (黑胡椒), 2 tsp light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp dark soy sauce (老抽).* You can already see the Western influence here! By white wine we mean like, actual white wine. From grapes. It’s basically the Macanese equivalent of Shaoxing and is used in much the same way. Black pepper also makes an appearance (black pepper is a *very* regional thing in China). 

3.	*Sausage, preferably Portugese Linguiça (香肠/葡国香肠), 250g.* Kind of optional bit, but this recipe was balanced around including it. Feel free to go liberal with the sausage subs here – it’s what we had to do, honestly. In the video, we used a Harbin sausage (哈尔滨红肠), which’s basically… a kielbasa. It worked, it tasted good. But a much more authentic sub would likely be a Spanish-style chorizo or an Italian sausage, so you might actually be able to get closer to the proper taste than we did (sausage is expensive and tough to source in Shenzhen).

4.	*Optional ‘marinade’ for the sausage: ¼ tsp Cantonese rose wine (玫瑰露酒), ½ tsp sugar.* Ok, so here’s the deal – we saw one source (in English actually, the chef of Fat Rice in Chicago IIRC) mention in passing that some Macanese linguiça took inspiration from Cantonese Lap Cheong and were seasoned with Cantonese rose wine (and were a bit sweeter). So on a whim, we mixed some sugar and rose wine into the sausage, and… we really liked what it did for the dish. But just know that this might just be us up the creek with no paddle here, feel free to skip.

5.	*Potatoes, 500g.* Russets or something similarly starchy. Cut into 2 cm cubes, blanched, then fried.

6.	*Onion (洋葱), 1.* Minced.

7.	*Garlic, ~4 cloves.* Minced. Some recipes also use shallots.

8.	*Dried bay leaf (香叶), 1g; 4-5 large leaves.* I’d call this a real hallmark of the dish, if only there weren’t counter-examples of some Macanese families skipping the bay leaf. The vast majority of Minchi is fried with bay though.

9.	*Seasoning while stir-frying: 1 tbsp white wine (白葡萄酒), ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp sugar, 1 tsp light soy sauce (生抽), ¼ tsp black pepper (黑胡椒), 1 tbsp rice vinegar (米醋).*

10.	*Egg, 1.* For frying.

Also, interestingly, olive oil is a really common frying oil in Macanese cooking – basically the Macanese equivalent of peanut oil. So if you’re used to reaching the olive oil, go for it. 

**Process:**

Super high level overview here: mince your meat, then marinate it. Fry the mince meat once until dry and crumbly, then stir-fry everything together. Serve with white rice, fried potatoes, and a sunny side up egg.

1.	*Mince the meat.* If hand mincing, first get the beef and pork into a nice fine dice. Then just grab a couple cleavers and… just start chopping, periodically folding the meat over itself to help it break down. Unlike something like a dumpling filling, we’re not looking to get it into a paste or anything… so if you’re quick just ~5 minutes of chopping should be good enough. [You’re looking for something about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/szD06Ao.png) no matter which mincing route you take.

2.	*Marinate the minced meat.* Marinate for ~30 minutes.

3.	*Prep the rest of the ingredients: cut the potatoes into 2 cm cubes, mince the onion and garlic, finely dice the sausage.* Marinate the sausage if you’re going that route with us.

4.	*Blanch the potato in boiling water for two minutes, together with a tablespoon of salt.* Toss the potato cubes in the salted boiling water and cover. Let those cook for two minutes, then take them out to drain. Don’t shock in cool water, it can break down the potato cubes.

5.	*Once dry, pan-fry the potato cubes until golden brown and crispy, ~20 minutes over medium-low heat -or- deep fry them at ~180C until golden brown.* I would probably just deep fry these if it were me, but I always feel a little bad calling for deep-frying in an ostensibly homey recipe like this. So if pan-frying, over medium-low flame together with ~1/4 cup of oil… add the potatoes in one even-ish layer (no need to be overly obsessive with the whole ‘one layer’ thing and fry… periodically stirring them around, then rearranging them again into a rough layer. Season with a touch of salt (let’s say… start with ½ tsp and go from there to taste) and optionally black pepper. Reserve.

6.	*Fry the minced meat (together with the sausage IF your sausage is uncooked) until browned and loose.* As always, first longyau – get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil – here about one tablespoon – and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. With the flame on medium, add in the meat. Try your best to break up the minced meat, and we like to accomplish that by aggressively chopping at it with a spatula. After ~5 minutes, [the meat should look like this](https://i.imgur.com/HalsNes.png) – loose and cooked. Then, lower the heat to medium-low and continue to fry for five minutes until the meat is [browned, like this](https://i.imgur.com/8DeeINr.png). 

7.	*Stir fry the Minchi.* As always, first longyau – get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil – here 1 tablespoon – and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface. Heat on medium now:

* Onion, in. Fry for ~5 minutes until the onion is softened and has changed color. 
 
* Scooch the onion up the side of the wok, then add in a bit more oil - ~1/2 tbsp. Add in the garlic.

* Fry garlic for ~30 seconds or until fragrant.

* Add in the dried bay leaves. Fry everything together for ~30 seconds.

* Pour the 1 tbsp white wine over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Quick mix.

* Sausage, in. Assuming your sausage is a cooked one (if you cooked it in step #6 just add it in with the other meat, obviously). 30 second fry.

* Minced meat, in. 1 minute fry together.

* Season with the salt, sugar, black pepper, and light soy sauce. Brief mix.

* Pour the 1 tbsp rice vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Heat off, out.

Ok, so there’s one final step here – frying the egg. Reddit formatting really hates when I break up a numbered list, so…

**Fry the Egg.** Whatever method you like. I like tossing ~two tbsp of oil or so in a cast iron skillet, then heating that up over medium-high heat until bubbles form around a pair of chopsticks. Crack an egg in, let it set, shut off the heat. Tilt the pan so the oil pools, then spoon it over the whites of the egg. Once the whites are cooked, I pour one spoon of oil over the yolk because I personally like my sunny-side up yolks more ‘gooey’ then leaking all over the plate (though tbh with a bed of rice like this dish, I could go either way). Season with salt and pepper, or whatever.

**Assemble:** This dish makes six – a rarity in these recipes, I know. Over a bed of white rice, spoon over a bunch of your minchi. Make a bit of a ring around everything with the fried potatoes, top with your egg. As an aside… random totally super untraditional thing that I kind of like on the side with this dish… some vinegary American or Mexican hot sauce, specifically for the potatoes.",mthmchris,cooking,Recipe Macao Minchi a Ground Meat Stir Fry  So today I wanted to teach you how to make Macanese Minchi Its one of the most iconic dishes in Macao and really emblematic of

56,cwum9c,Trying to put together a troubleshooting guide for new (or easily stressed) cooks. Any suggestions for things that should be included?,"I'm currently in a treatment program for an eating disorder. Something that I've noticed about myself and other people in my program is that when we cook, if a recipe doesn't go right, a lot of times we just panic and feel really shitty. When I think about these times in hindsight, I start to think of things that I could have done to salvage the recipe instead of just declaring it a failure. 

A few examples of the type of thing that I'm looking for:

1. The cake stuck to the pan lifehack that floats around the internet - If you forgot to prepare a pan before baking, scrape it out and make something new.
2. If you're making a sauce and you realize you oversalted, add more substance and make a larger batch to dilute the salt
3. If you're making a slow cooker recipe and you used the wrong type of canned tomatoes, so it's way too watery, either put it on the stove to simmer and reduce or convert it to a soup
4. The tips that Claire from Bon Appetit gives in [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIunYVkv_S1fOYtFjuQ3znZsSnZksyU) on what to do if you do things like add cold butter when it's supposed to be room temp

Just... Anything that you can think of where you might try a recipe, and get to a point where you say ""Oh, I fucked up,"" and then how you can come back from that and salvage the dish and still make the recipe, or transform it into something else that's also good. Or if there's an error you've made, where you couldn't salvage the dish, but you were able to learn what to do next time to avoid that pitfall.

77,cx500j,Help with recipe ideas for medical condition,"So a few years ago my dad had surgery to remove a tumor in his sinuses. It went great, he's fine, except he had some nerve damage that caused one side of his mouth to be completely numb. We're talking doesn't need Novocaine for a root canal numb. He could still taste and chew on the other side, so food was still enjoyable. This has been changing in the past year or so, culminating in him telling me last night that he now just ate because he was hungry, and not because he enjoyed the taste or texture of food. My uber carnivore dad now tells me that he prefers not to eat meat because it is too chewy and gets stuck in his teeth.

Here's where I need your help. I do most of the cooking for our family of 3, and I want to adapt or find new recipes that will suit him and us (mom and I) better. So if you wouldn't mind giving some suggestions, either links to recipes or the names of dishes that I could research, that would be great. Thank you in advance!

Requirements/preferences:

Mushrooms are fine, but mom doesn't like the texture (so I would need to sub a different protein for her)

None of us are willing to try tofu. That is a hard no from both of them, and it triggers migraines for me.

Beans of all kinds are good for my parents, but I'm not really a fan. But I don't mind making two dishes (one for me and one for them sometimes)

We like spice, but not a lot of heat (except for dad, who can always add hot sauce, etc). 

Physical restrictions:

I have RA, so I have to prep in stages and prefer things that don't have to be constantly be stirred or monitored. We have an induction range, immersion circulator, Instant Pot, 5 Qt crockpot, microwave, stand mixer, and a bread machine. I live in a smaller town in the Midwest so some specialty ingredients are hard to find, unless they come from Amazon.

And I've seen some recipes include stuff like pork spare ribs, short ribs, oxtail. What about straight chuck or pork shoulder?  Do meats like this have any risk of making the sauce too fatty or stew like?

How about leaner meats? Do these still play a role?  I sometimes see stuff like pork chops or braciole made from lean cuts in there. Is this type of stuff better off being added near the end? Finally, how about meatballs/sausage- can they withstand a long slow simmer without getting tough and dry?

105,cwhf4l,Wtf is happening to chicken prices?,"Chicken has often been used a 'loss leader', going on and off sale at times, but this year has been very different, at least here in Southern California at our biggest chain grocery store, Vons/Safeway.  


For the last few months, our stores have simply been rotating a price of about $0.88/lb for thighs or drumsticks or quarters, then alternating at that same price for split breast halves (with a small amount of bone).

I was cooking a chicken breast last night and after extensive research about getting the pan to the perfect heat and whatnot, everything was going fine until it was almost done. So I added olive oil, the chicken and cooked one side for a bit then flipped it and began cooking the other side. Everything was going great. I'd say the chicken was nearly finished the all of a sudden the pan started discoloring and brown spots started appearing around the edges of the pan and the center of the pan started to burn and stuff was sticking to it. I don't udnerstand what I did wrong. I think it might have to do with me moving the chicken at some point after I had flipped it while I was checking the progress of it and the oil had moved therefore causing it to burn? I really don't know. Also a general question about stainless steel cookware. Does the age of the pan affect the way the pan would cook. Say the pan has been washed with abrasive sponges and whatnot. Would the scratches affect how oil would protect the pan/food while cooking?

171,cwj7dt,What can you do with parsley?,"Edit: just found this, but feel free to contribute:

Parsley is widely used in Middle Eastern, European, Brazilian, and Americancooking. Curly leaf parsley is used often as a garnish. Green parsley is used frequently as a garnish on potato dishes (boiled or mashed potatoes), on rice dishes (risotto or pilaf), on fish, fried chicken, lamb, goose, and steaks, as well in meat or vegetable stews (including shrimp creole, beef bourguignon, goulash, or chicken paprikash).[18]

In central Europe, eastern Europe, and southern Europe, as well as in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green, chopped parsley sprinkled on top. In southern and central Europe, parsley is part of bouquet garni, a bundle of fresh herbs used as an ingredient in stocks, soups, and sauces. Freshly chopped green parsley is used as a topping for soups such as chicken soup, green salads, or salads such as salade Olivier, and on open sandwiches with cold cuts or pâtés.

Persillade is a mixture of chopped garlic and chopped parsley in French cuisine.

Parsley is the main ingredient in Italian salsa verde, which is a mixed condiment of parsley, capers, anchovies, garlic, and sometimes bread, soaked in vinegar. It is an Italian custom to serve it with bollito misto or fish. Gremolata, a mixture of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest, is a traditional accompaniment to the Italian veal stew, ossobuco alla milanese.

In England, parsley sauce is a roux-based sauce, commonly served over fish or gammon.

Root parsley is very common in Central, Eastern, and Southern European cuisines, where it is used as a snack or a vegetable in many soups, stews, and casseroles, and as ingredient for broth.

In Brazil, freshly chopped parsley (salsa) and freshly chopped scallion (cebolinha) are the main ingredients in the herb seasoning called cheiro-verde (literally ""green aroma""), which is used as key seasoning for major Brazilian dishes, including meat, chicken, fish, rice, beans, stews, soups, vegetables, salads, condiments, sauces, and stocks. Cheiro-verde is sold in food markets as a bundle of both types of fresh herbs. In some Brazilian regions, chopped parsley may be replaced by chopped coriander (also called cilantro, coentro in Portuguese) in the mixture.

Parsley is a key ingredient in several Middle Eastern salads such as Lebanese tabbouleh; it is also often mixed in with the chickpeas and/or fava beans while making falafel (that gives the inside of the falafel its green color).",stephfowler,cooking,What can you do with parsley Edit just found this but feel free to contributeParsley is widely used inMiddle EasternEuropeanBrazilian andAmericancooking Curly leaf parsley is used often as agarnish Green parsley is used frequently as a garnish on potato dishes boiled or mashed potatoes on rice dishes risottoorpilaf on fish fried chicken lamb goose andsteaks as well in meat or vegetable stews including shrimp creolebeef bourguignongoulash orchicken paprikashIn central Europe eastern Europe and southern Europe as well as in western Asia many dishes are served with fresh green chopped parsley sprinkled on top In southern and central Europe parsley is part ofbouquet garni a bundle of fresh herbs used as an ingredient instockssoups andsauces Freshly chopped green parsley is used as a topping for soups such aschicken soup green salads or salads such assalade Olivier and onopen sandwicheswith cold cuts orptsPersilladeis a mixture of choppedgarlicand chopped parsley inFrench cuisineParsley is the main ingredient in Italiansalsa verde which is a mixed condiment of parsley capers anchovies garlic and sometimes bread soaked in vinegar It is an Italian custom to serve it withbollito mistoor fishGremolata a mixture of parsley garlic and lemon zest is a traditional accompaniment to the Italian veal stewossobuco alla milaneseIn England parsley sauce is arouxbased sauce commonly served over fish orgammonRoot parsley is very common inCentralEastern andSouthern Europeancuisines where it is used as a snack or a vegetable in many soups stews andcasseroles and as ingredient forbrothInBrazil freshly chopped parsley salsa and freshly choppedscallioncebolinha are the main ingredients in the herb seasoning calledcheiroverdeliterally green aroma which is used as key seasoning for majorBrazilian dishes including meat chicken fish rice beans stews soups vegetables salads condiments sauces andstocksCheiroverdeis sold in food markets as a bundle of both types of fresh herbs In some Brazilian regions chopped parsley may be replaced by choppedcorianderalso called cilantrocoentroin Portuguese in the mixtureParsley is a key ingredient in several Middle Eastern salads such as Lebanesetabbouleh it is also often mixed in with thechickpeasandorfava beanswhile makingfalafelthat gives the inside of the falafel its green color,1

You don't need to list 10 pieces but I decided it sounded like a good number.

I'll link the article for comparison.

https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/12/gift-guide-essential-pots-and-pans-presents-for-home-cooks.html

Really good frying pan. 10 inches is a good size and it's better a little larger than smaller. I don't buy into the cast iron hype. Aluminum can be good but unless it's lined I personally wouldn't do acidic ingredients or pan sauces in them. My go to is a 2.5mm thick copper pan lined with Stainless Steel.

12 1/2 inch Rondeau/Dutch Oven. Again I think Cast Iron is over rated and go with thick copper lined with stainless steel. With this style of pan you knock out the dutch oven, saute pan and small stock pot in 1 go. This is my moms favorite piece of cookware.

3 Qt Saucier, the 1 piece of equipment I don't have I think I would like. In the mean time my Sauce pans do well enough at the moment when I don't want to use my huge pan.

Agreed with the 10 in nonstick pan; I really don't use a wok...

If you got an 8 qt multi purpose pan than the most useful stock pot size is a 16 qt sized one in my experience. I also have a 24 qt one I've used just as much but I don't think other people would share that sentiment with me.

Agreed with the aluminum baking sheets. I've seen a visible difference in baked goods when using a 12-13 gauge sheet vs the standard 18 gauge so the thicker the better.

A casserole pan is standard but I don't think they need to be made out of ceramic and other gratin pans can be useful. An important thing is aesthetics though...

That really is a bummer!

I notice that the more uses with the oil, the longer things take to cook as well. I change oil after about every 5 uses, maybe. I use flash frozen wings and thaw and dry them first.

1) Does anybody combination cook to get a better result? Like oven first, then deep fry? I have a Japanese fish oven at home that uses high heat and close flame and that is an option as well.

2) Maybe I’m overcrowding the bucket? But it’s hard to feed everyone if I can only cook a paltry few at a time. Cooking time ranges from 13 min. on new oil to 22 min on older oil, which seems crazy long to fry. But changing the oil is something I’m not trying to do every other day!

I have a great butterscotch cinnamon ice cream that I'd like to add a butterscotch cinnamon ripple w/ some streusel mixed in. I have a good recipe for a butterscotch ripple but it calls for lemon to counteract the richness of the butterscotch. Since I want to go cinnamon with this, I figure the easiest way is to remove the lemon. 

The recipe calls for:
* 2 1/4 cups cream
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons dark rum
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 cup glucose syrup
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1/4 cup butter

I'm the kind of cook that sucks and I'd just hold the zest and lemon juice out right? Then add maybe a teaspoon of cinnamon powder? Well, before I do that I figured I'd ask you guys because by removing those things I'd somehow cause a fire to start in my kitchen and it taste awful. That's the kind of cook I am haha.

283,cvrzgk,Pan Fried Salmon Always Sticks,"Title. No matter what I try, what recipe I follow, whenever I make pan fried salmon it always sticks horrendously. To go in a little more detail, I'll coat the salmon in some olive oil, and then a little bit of salt and pepper right before putting it in the pan. Then I put it skin side down into a pan on medium/medium-high heat. After 4-5 minutes, when I go to flip it, the skin is always stuck firmly to the pan, and I have to scrape it off so it doesn't burn, tearing it off the rest of the fish in the process.

In the end, the fish never comes out tasting bad or even particularly burnt, but does anyone have any tricks to stop this happening?

Update: As suggested by many comments, I did three main things: 1) I made sure the pan/oil was REALLY hot before placing in the fish, to the point of almost smoking. I also only put oil in the pan instead of coating the fish as well, but not sure how much of a difference that made. 2) I dried the skin REALLY well, which was easier that expected since unlike drying a steak or so once it’s dry it pretty much stays dry. 3) I used tongs to place it in the pan, and kept it moving constantly until a crust had formed, less than a minute.

I’m just getting tired of choking on the fumes emitted from his efforts.

It’s already a non stick pan so the oil just kind of sits there, but either he doesn’t know it’s non stick or he doesn’t care. Next he tosses the shrimp in and spices them with Italian seasoning and (I think) crushed red peppers (or ground, which I think would be better anyway but I can’t tell as I usually evacuate).

297,cvrml9,Tried to recreate my friend's steak recipe: what went wrong?,"Hey guys!

So I want to surprise my friend by cooking a steak that he once made for me awhile back. His steak was really good and juicy with the medium rare goodness. The ingredients that he used complimented all other ingredients which made it taste so good.

So what he did is he put the steak, added some mustard and honey, cooked it for a few minutes, flipped it and added some leeks and tomatoes at the end.

I tried it tonight, but it didnt end so well. I already smelled burned honey on the third minute while i was cooking the first side, and it got really burned after  i flipped it until it was cooked. I wanted a medium rare, but i ended up with a very well done steak as well. I put more than a tablespoon of mustard and honey as well. and because of the burned honey, the tomatoes and leek didnt taste so good  too. Everything is a mix of sweet and bitter-ish flavor.

298,cvrchf,Meat expiration dates vs bought date,"Hi all, I’m asking a question that I’ve been pondering for a long time and have been getting conflicting information. 

How long can I keep meat in the fridge? Sometimes I’ll buy ground beef from Costco or chicken thighs and the “use by or freeze by” date is 2 weeks out. 

Question 1: can I use that meat up until the date on the package? 

Question 2: Would it help if I took the meat out, such as the thighs and vacuum sealed it and kept it in the fridge?

Question 3: If you freeze meat, and then decide to thaw overnight in the fridge, how many days can it stay in the fridge? Sometimes dinner plans change and you’ve got meat that thawed already. 

I’ve read that:
- once you buy meat from the store, only keep it in the fridge for 3-4 days
- grocery stores have commercial coolers which will keep the meat colder than household refrigerators which is why they can keep the meat out

300,cvqv96,Ice-cream machine and dishwasher accident,"Hi! I've been enjoying making ice-Creams for many years now, using a Krups ice-cream maker that's basically a huge bowl-shaped ice pack that needs to be chilled in the refrigerator before using (then you add the mixing element like a lid onto the bowl, and pour in your batter). This bowl isn't supposed to be heated above 40°C nor should it go into the dishwasher. Which it unfortunately did last night.


Does anyone have any idea how bad this is? The bowl is still in one piece, but the special heat-transfer coating on the inside now no longer has a shiny&amp;chrome look, but became dull and has got a dusty texture. I'm guessing it will now yield results  somewhere in the range of consequences between the ice cream maker now being less effective and taking longer to freeze the batter, it not working at all anymore or it exploding when freezing or thawing. Obviously if I can still use it I'd rather not get a new one, but I don't actually want to use it before I know if that could be risky.

324,cvigkn,I made a post 4 days ago about making a cake with no baking powder. I made it and am here to share it along with the recipe.,"I promised an update after baking it, so here it is. 

https://imgur.com/a/jFUpYwF

There is a picture of it. 

I literally searched ""Great Depression chocolate cake recipe"" on Google, and came across a great recipe, and substituted a couple of things, and the cake came out as it is above. 

Here is the recipe, copied and pasted from the webpage with my substitutions also added next to each thing I substituted:

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 cup sugar

1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (my cocoa powder is regular cocoa powder from Aldi, not Dutch)

1/2 teaspoon salt (I just used some from my grinder, it's all I have, I have no measuring spoons)

1 teaspoon baking soda (I used a regular sized eating utensil for this)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract (I have no vanilla so had to go without)

1 teaspoon white vinegar (I substituted one teaspoon of sour cream)

1/3 cup vegetable oil (I substituted two teaspoons of butter, melted in the microwave) 

1 cup water (I substituted 1/2 cup of chocolate milk and 1/2 cup of regular milk)

Baking Directions:

Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda in a large mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl, combine vanilla, vinegar, oil and water. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix until completely combined and no lumps remain.

Pour batter into a greased 8x8 square pan. (I used a 9×13 nonstick metal pan, greased with butter and then put flour onto the butter)

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. (For my particular sized pan, I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and the toothpick came out clean.)

Let cake cool completely before frosting.

350,cvfdt0,[Question][Vegan] Suggestions for Almonmilk Icecream Recipe?,"I have a basic recipe for Almond Milk ""whipped topping"" that I've converted into an ""Almond Milk Icecream"" recipe.

# Whipped Topping

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 Cup Vanilla Almondmilk
* 1/2 Cup Safflower (or other mild-flavored oil)
* 1 Tbsp Powdered Sugar
* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/4 Tsp Xantham gum

**Directions**

1. Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until it reaches the desired consistency.
2. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using it.

# Ice Cream (My Alterations)

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 Cup ~~Vanilla Almondmilk~~ Homemade Almondmilk *(Creamier, roughly 1:1 ratio water-almonds)*
* 1/2 Cup ~~Safflower Oil~~  Canola Oil *(Easy to find, cheap)*
* ~~1 Tbsp Powdered Sugar~~ 2 Tbsp Powdered Sugar (Necessary sweetness, prevent ice crystals)
* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
* ~~1/4 Tsp Xanthan Gum~~ 1/2 Tsp Guar Gum *(Helps with consistency)*
* 2 Tbsp Sugar (Necessary sweetness, prevent ice crystals)

**Directions**

1. Prepare the homemade almond milk. (Blanch almonds and peel skins, soak almonds overnight or 8 hours, grind with equal parts rinsed almonds equal parts water, strain)
2. Dissolve sugar in homemade almond milk over medium heat (\~ 5 minutes)
3. Allow homemade almond milk to return to room temperature or store in fridge to cool
4. Combine all the ingredients to a blender and blend until it reaches the desired consistency.
5. Freeze overnight (or roughly 8-12 hours depending on how cool your freezer is)

**Dilemma**

This recipe more-or-less works. However, there's a slight mouthfeel problem that I've encountered that I'm hoping to solve. I'm not sure if it's because of the additional guar gum, or the use of the canola oil. I plan on testing both things, but if one of you food scientist types wants to chime in, I'm all ears. I'd prefer to use some other sort of fat instead of the canola oil, but I'm not sure which one would make the most sense while still keeping things ""vegan."" I, myself, am not vegan, but I figured if I was going to make dairy free ice cream myself with almond milk, I should be able to find a way to do it that used no animal products whatsoever.

425,cuwo8a,Help with adjusting cooking time for a recipe I'm altering,"Original recipe is below:

*Pan Roasted Chicken and Vegetables*

*Ingredients:

8 red potatoes, washed and cut into 1inch chunks

1/2 large onion, cut into 1inch pieces

20 baby carrots

8oz mushrooms

4 bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed

*Roasting Seasoning:

3tbsp veg oil

3 garlic cloves, minced

1tsp salt

1.5 tsp dried crushed rosemary

3/4 tsp pepper

1/2 tsp paprika

*Directions (somewhat paraphrased):

Preheat oven to 425. Spray 9x13 baking pan with cooking spray. Make seasoning mix, combine veggies, put half the seasoning mix on veggies and layer on bottom of pan. Coat chicken with rest of seasoning mix, place on top of veggies. Bake in oven for 40-45mins.

Now, the original recipe has some major flaws, mostly with the veggies. That amount of veggies is so thick in the pan, they're practically raw even if the chicken is perfectly cooked. The chicken and the seasoning is pretty bomb, so I'm tweaking this recipe to make it better.

First, I've cut the amount of veggies in half. 4 potatoes, 10 carrots, etc. I tried that once, and it worked better, but then I had to cut the potatoes smaller and the carrots were still hard in the middle. It's still PLENTY of veggies for us.

Today I basically diced the potatoes and cut the  carrots in half. I also want to DOUBLE the amount of chicken, so 8 chicken thighs on top. I already doubled the amount of seasoning mix I made to make sure I have enough (I'm ok with having too much as it's delicious). 

My main question is how should I adjust the cooking time for this? Should I bake it for the same time as before (45mins at 425 seemed to be right for the 4 thighs), or should I bake it for a full hour, or would that make the chicken tough? My main struggle thus far has been the veggies, so I'm worried about balancing it all.

TL;DR: Baking 8 chix thighs instead of 4 chix thighs over bed of veggies. Original recipe says 45mins at 425F. How long should I bake it now?

i am trying to do my best at doing pizza dough, after some research i found out that many doughs are prepared over 24-48h. So here is the thing.

I live in Spain, so the climate here is warm-hot.

When i woke up, the dough is very sticky and really hard to work with, i end up with a lot of dough in my hands.

What did i do wrong? Should i rise it in the fridge overnight instead of the room?

What Do You Need?

For Dough

2 cups whole milk,   warm (480 mL)

½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)

1 stick unsalted butter, melted

2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast

5 cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus more for dusting (625 g)

1 teaspoon baking powder

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, for greasing the pan

For Filling

¾ cup light brown sugar (165 g)

1 ½ sticks unsalted butter, softened

2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

14 strips cooked bacon

For Icing

½ cup maple syrup (165 g)

4 oz cream cheese, cubed and softened (115 g)

½ cup powdered sugar (60 g)

Method

* Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, granulated sugar, and melted butter. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100–110°F (37–43°C). If any warmer, let cool slightly.
* Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, whisk to incorporate, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes, until foamy.
* Add 4 cups (500 G) of flour to the milk mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined.
* Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size.
* Meanwhile, make the filling: In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Set aside.
* Generously grease a 9-inch (22 cm) round baking pan with the softened butter and set aside.
* Uncover the dough and add the remaining cup of flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well to incorporate.
* Turn the dough out onto a clean surface. Leave a bit of flour nearby to use as needed, but try not to incorporate too   much. Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness. The dough should be very smooth and spring back when poked.
* Roll the dough out into a 14-inch (35 cm) square about ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. Square the corners with a bench scraper or a spatula to make sure they are sharp and even.
* Spread the filling evenly over the dough.
* Slice the dough lengthwise into seven pieces that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide.
* Place two strips of bacon on each piece of dough. Starting from one short end, roll up each strip of dough and pinch the seam closed.
* Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pan, 1 in the center and six around the sides. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 35–45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their original volume.
* Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
* Bake the cinnamon rolls for 35–40 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes.
* While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the icing: In a small pot, cook the maple syrup over medium-high until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from heat and let cool slightly about 5 minutes.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together the reduced maple syrup, cream cheese, and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy.
* Drizzle the icing over the cinnamon rolls, using the back of a spoon to spread if desired.
* Enjoy!

498,ctwsaj,Recipe: Chinese Cumin Roast Lamb (烤羊排),"So I wanted to show you how to make an awesome dish from the Northwest of China, roast lamb ribs.

I’m not sure if these guys have made it across the Pacific or not yet – it seems that usually Northwestern-style Chinese food abroad seems to be confined to noodle joints. For the unaware, these ribs ostensibly do what they say on the tin – lamb, roasted, covered in a cumin-heavy Northwest-style rub.

But what really makes the dish, to me at least, is their texture. “Fall off the bone” is a cliché that I tend to try to avoid, but… yeah. These are fall off the bone. But what makes them so interesting to me is how they get there – coming from the West, we’d probably assume there’s some sort of slow roasting situation going on. Nah. At their core, these ribs are poached or braised… then blasted in an oven at a high temp. Basically, the same idea as a reverse sear.

It’s a cool approach, and makes for some lamb ribs that’re easy to love. 

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/Y5f7IYUC9jw).

**Ingredients:**

1.	*Full lamb ribs, 3, sliced in half -or- lamb spareribs, 6.* So right, the ribs that we get here in China are like the full thing, and not really trimmed of any excess fat. So if you’re either based in China or have a solid butcher… get them to do that. Three ribs, sliced down the middle so you get three chops and three spareribs. Of course, I *know* that you can’t exactly stumble into a Wholefoods and get a whole lamb rib… it seems that you’re generally stuck with either (A) spareribs or (B) a frenched rack of chops. In that case, I’d personally go with spareribs… I’m just really worried that the Western-style lamb chops would be too lean here.  Either way, fresh is better but frozen is totally ok.

2.	*For the soaking liquid: 1.5L of hot, boiled water; ½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒); ~2 inches crushed ginger (姜) -or- enough water to submerge the ribs together with a solid glug (~2tbsp) of Shaoxing wine.* Ok, so we’ll get into the whole soaking process later, but the idea is to remove some of that slight ‘off’ odor that lamb can sometimes be guilty of. The classic way Chinese cooking handles that is with some Liaojiu/Shaoxing wine, but a solid chunk of the Chinese Northwest is Muslim – so wine’s obviously a no-go. So let’s just keep this Halal and use Ginger-Sichuan Peppercorn water… i.e. water steeped with those ingredients. Serves much the same function as Shaoxing wine… balances those odors.

3.	*For the poaching liquid: ½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns (花椒), ~4 dried chilis, thoroughly deseeded (干辣椒), ~2 inches smashed ginger, 1 Dacong/Daepa/Welsh Onion (大葱) -or- ~3 sprigs of scallion (葱).* All of these aromatics are basically optional, but it’s nice to simmer the lamb with them. For that Dacong – that’s the Chinese aromatic that’s usually (mis)translated as ‘leek’. If it’s easy for you to buy, great; if not, really don’t worry about it. Use a few scallions and tie them in a knot, or just skip it.

4.	*For the rub: 5 tsp cumin seeds (孜然), 2.5 tsp toasted sesame seeds (炒芝麻), 1 tsp fennel seed (小茴香), 1 tsp chili powder (辣椒面), 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp MSG (味精).* Both the cumin seeds and sesame seeds are ‘half ground’ – i.e. cumin blitzed in a coffee or spice grinder for ~10 seconds… sesame seeds slightly pounded in a mortar just to get out a bit of their oil. Fennel seed’s finely ground, ditto with the MSG.

5.	*Oil, preferably sunflower oil (葵花籽油) and/or rendered lamb fat, 2-3 tbsp.* To be messaged into the lamb before marinating with the rub.

6.	*For dipping: 1.5 tsp chili flakes (辣椒粉), ½ tsp chili powder (辣椒面), ½ tsp salt, optional 1/8 tsp Sichuan peppercorn powder (花椒粉), optional sprinkle MSG (味精).* For this, by a sprinkle I mean really a sprinkle… like, ~10 crystals or so, pounded into a powder.  

**Process:**

Ok, so high level overview here: soak, poach, dry, rub with oil and the spice rub, marinate, blast at high temp. 

Now, know that with that second bit – the poaching – there’s a few different directions you can go. I won’t bore you too much with it here… check out the note below for more info there.

1.	*If using, make the Ginger-Sichuan Peppercorn water.* Add that hot, boiled water to the smashed ginger and Sichuan peppercorns and let it steep. Uncovered with that amount, it’ll probably need ~1 hour to get back to room temperature. If you’re pressed for time, after the ten minute mark you could get away with tossing some ice packs in to cool it down. 

2.	*Add the ribs to the water and soak for one hour.* After the hour mark, you’ll notice that this’ll really start to draw out the myoglobin from the meat – the lamb’ll look much paler in color. This soaking process helps remove the ‘shanwei’ or ‘lamby odor’ from the meat. And while your “ BS old wives’ tale” sensors might be flaring up and flashing… I promise that to my taste buds at least, it feels like it’s doing something. What’s that something? Not sure. From my hours of googling and trying to parse papers that I have no background to properly contextualize… I have a hypothesis, but I’m not going to share it because this is *exactly* how pseudo-science can spread. If you happen to have a background in organic chemistry/food science though, definitely drop a line so I can run what I’m thinking by you. 

3.	*Remove, and slice off any excess fat.* I mean, lamb ribs **should** be fatty. Don’t be paranoid here – it’s just that for the lamb we get here in China, sometimes there’s like a slab of pure fat that’s just like dangling off the ribs. Lamb spare ribs should be almost as fatty as pork belly. Save that excess lamb fat if you got it though, we’ll be rendering it out later on.

4.	*Poach the lamb: add the lamb and the other poaching ingredients in a pot with cool water. Cover, and over medium high flame bring up to a boil. Once it’s at a heavy simmer, start to skim out any gunk, and let it continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Then cover, shut off the heat, and let it sit there for ~90 minutes.* Ok right, so this is one possible method you can use here. The logic is that we’re never actually getting the liquid all that hot – we’re getting it up to about ~90C, then slowly dropping it down through poaching temperature to room temp. Steph says that the lack of quick temperature change makes the meat juicer, but unfortunately I can’t find anything to support that claim – so I think more than anything, we’re really more poaching than braising here. Again, there’s a few ways to crack this nut – for a few more ideas, check out the note below.

5.	*Once the liquid’s cooled down (~40C is ok)… remove, pat with a paper towel and dry for 30-90 minutes.*  If this’s still wet when we toss it in the oven, it can inhibit browning. I’m a bit paranoid on that front, so I keep it out drying on a rack for ~90 minutes.

6.	*Optional: dice the excess lamb fat, then render it by frying together with ~1 tbsp of of sunflower oil over medium-low heat.* Render out however much oil you like – I usually go a full ~15 minutes because the leftover lamb cracklins are like my dog’s all-time favorite food. Or if you have a particularly fatty cut of lamb, feel free to start the process in water just as if you were rendering lard. If you’ve got extra fat… melted lamb fat is a great thing to drizzle over cous cous.

7.	*Toast the sesame seeds.* Nice thing to have around. In a dry wok/skillet, over medium low heat toast the sesame seeds for ~3-5 minutes, or until they begin to brown slightly. Make a big batch. When it comes to stuff hanging around your pantry, toasted sesame seeds &gt; untoasted sesame seeds.

8.	*Make the spice rub: in a coffee or spice grinder, grind the fennel seed into a fine powder; grind the cumin seed for ~10 seconds. Thoroughly crush the MSG in a mortar, lightly crush the sesame seeds to release a bit of oil. Mix together.* For the ‘half ground’ cumin seeds you’re looking for something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/kjwNNRt.png), and for the sesame seeds you’re looks for something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/o38bXtz.png).

9.	*Massage the oil into the now-dry lamb ribs, followed by the seasoining. Get your hands dirty… do a bang up job getting every inch. Marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to over night.* Preferably marinate overnight. Seems to work well.

10.	*Preheat oven to 220C. Roast for 15 minutes, turning halfway through. Serve with seasoned chili flakes.* Why 220C? Mostly because it’s the max our crappy little halogen oven can do… so that’s what we tested. Check out the note below on ‘roasting alternatives’.


**Note on poaching alternatives:**

So a big help in nailing down this recipe was our local beef/lamb butcher, who’s from Gansu (Chinese sources are even frustratingly touch and go for this dish) 

For him, he does a straight simmer for ~60-90 minutes. Like, get the water hot, turn down the flame, toss it in and simmer.  That method’s good too, and would probably be the more authentic way to go about the dish. That said… when we tried that in our tests, the lean part of the chop got that whole dry-yet-soft quality that you sometimes find if you simmer meats without much fat/collagen for a long time (e.g. the lean pork used to flavor Cantonese soups). The ribs were perfect though. So If you wanted to do that, I’d probably drop the chops in with ~20 minutes to go or so to make sure they don’t overcook.

The thing was, I really wanted to mimic the roast lamb ribs that we get at the very best Xinjiang restaurant in the city. The cold water start method was much, much closer to the super soft texture that they’ve got going on at that restaurant there, so that’s what we went with.

Another pretty famous lamb restaurant in Shenzhen uses a pressure cooker for their stuff, I’m 97% sure. I remember a post on Baidu Zhidao (the Chinese equivalent of Quora) where cook from a restaurant that did roast lamb said they did 10-15 minutes in a pressure cooker? Can’t seem to find the post right now. If using a pressure cooker, try 10 minutes at first.

Alternatively… sous vide might be another decent choice… especially if you’re working from lamb chops. I personally don’t own a sous vide, but I think I’d go for ~65C (medium well), then finish the lamb roasting.

**Note on roasting alternatives:**

[Take a look at this picture here](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171226/caf30a5f3c9a4910a13bd93d9859a909.jpeg). This is the way that this is usually roasted – over charcoal… albeit up a distance, slowly rotating the lamb.

Ultimately, using a Western-style oven for this dish is *mimicking* that process – albeit, IMHO mimicking it pretty well. But feel free to finish this dish at your own discretion! If you want to finish with the grill, that might honestly be better. I’d probably play around with a two-zone heat set-up… cook it on the low side for a bit (~10 minutes) and finish on the hot side.

For the Western sort of ovens though? If I could test this at a shorter time/higher temperature, I would. Playing around with this at a lower temperature then finishing under the broiler could be a decent idea too. Basically, what I’m saying is that 220C for 15 minutes *works* - do that first – but please, feel free to get creative to perfect this recipe.",mthmchris,cooking,Recipe Chinese Cumin Roast Lamb  So I wanted to show you how to make an awesome dish from the Northwest of China roast lamb ribsIm not sure if these guys have made it across the Pacific or not yet  it seems that usually Northwesternstyle Chinese food abroad seems to be confined to noodle joints For the unaware these ribs ostensibly do what they say on the tin  lamb roasted covered in a cuminheavy Northweststyle rubBut what really makes the dish to me at least is their texture Fall off the bone is a clich that I tend to try to avoid but yeah These are fall off the bone But what makes them so interesting to me is how they get there  coming from the West wed probably assume theres some sort of slow roasting situation going on Nah At their core these ribs are poached or braised then blasted in an oven at a high temp Basically the same idea as a reverse searIts a cool approach and makes for some lamb ribs thatre easy to love Video is here if youd like a visual to follow alonghttpsyoutubeYfIYUCjwIngredientsFull lamb ribs  sliced in half or lamb spareribs  So right the ribs that we get here in China are like the full thing and not really trimmed of any excess fat So if youre either based in China or have a solid butcher get them to do that Three ribs sliced down the middle so you get three chops and three spareribs Of course I know that you cant exactly stumble into a Wholefoods and get a whole lamb rib it seems that youre generally stuck with either A spareribs or B a frenched rack of chops In that case Id personally go with spareribs Im just really worried that the Westernstyle lamb chops would be too lean here  Either way fresh is better but frozen is totally okFor the soaking liquid L of hot boiled water  tbsp Sichuan peppercorn   inches crushed ginger  or enough water to submerge the ribs together with a solid glug tbsp of Shaoxing wine Ok so well get into the whole soaking process later but the idea is to remove some of that slight off odor that lamb can sometimes be guilty of The classic way Chinese cooking handles that is with some LiaojiuShaoxing wine but a solid chunk of the Chinese Northwest is Muslim  so wines obviously a nogo So lets just keep this Halal and use GingerSichuan Peppercorn water ie water steeped with those ingredients Serves much the same function as Shaoxing wine balances those odorsFor the poaching liquid  tbsp Sichuan peppercorns   dried chilis thoroughly deseeded   inches smashed ginger  DacongDaepaWelsh Onion  or  sprigs of scallion  All of these aromatics are basically optional but its nice to simmer the lamb with them For that Dacong  thats the Chinese aromatic thats usually mistranslated as leek If its easy for you to buy great if not really dont worry about it Use a few scallions and tie them in a knot or just skip itFor the rub  tsp cumin seeds   tsp toasted sesame seeds   tsp fennel seed   tsp chili powder   tsp salt  tsp MSG  Both the cumin seeds and sesame seeds are half ground  ie cumin blitzed in a coffee or spice grinder for  seconds sesame seeds slightly pounded in a mortar just to get out a bit of their oil Fennel seeds finely ground ditto with the MSGOil preferably sunflower oil  andor rendered lamb fat  tbsp To be messaged into the lamb before marinating with the rubFor dipping  tsp chili flakes   tsp chili powder   tsp salt optional  tsp Sichuan peppercorn powder  optional sprinkle MSG  For this by a sprinkle I mean really a sprinkle like  crystals or so pounded into a powder  ProcessOk so high level overview here soak poach dry rub with oil and the spice rub marinate blast at high temp Now know that with that second bit  the poaching  theres a few different directions you can go I wont bore you too much with it here check out the note below for more info thereIf using make the GingerSichuan Peppercorn water Add that hot boiled water to the smashed ginger and Sichuan peppercorns and let it steep Uncovered with that amount itll probably need  hour to get back to room temperature If youre pressed for time after the ten minute mark you could get away with tossing some ice packs in to cool it down Add the ribs to the water and soak for one hour After the hour mark youll notice that thisll really start to draw out the myoglobin from the meat  the lambll look much paler in color This soaking process helps remove the shanwei or lamby odor from the meat And while your  BS old wives tale sensors might be flaring up and flashing I promise that to my taste buds at least it feels like its doing something Whats that something Not sure From my hours of googling and trying to parse papers that I have no background to properly contextualize I have a hypothesis but Im not going to share it because this is exactly how pseudoscience can spread If you happen to have a background in organic chemistryfood science though definitely drop a line so I can run what Im thinking by you Remove and slice off any excess fat I mean lamb ribs should be fatty Dont be paranoid here  its just that for the lamb we get here in China sometimes theres like a slab of pure fat thats just like dangling off the ribs Lamb spare ribs should be almost as fatty as pork belly Save that excess lamb fat if you got it though well be rendering it out later onPoach the lamb add the lamb and the other poaching ingredients in a pot with cool water Cover and over medium high flame bring up to a boil Once its at a heavy simmer start to skim out any gunk and let it continue to simmer for  minutes Then cover shut off the heat and let it sit there for  minutes Ok right so this is one possible method you can use here The logic is that were never actually getting the liquid all that hot  were getting it up to about C then slowly dropping it down through poaching temperature to room temp Steph says that the lack of quick temperature change makes the meat juicer but unfortunately I cant find anything to support that claim  so I think more than anything were really more poaching than braising here Again theres a few ways to crack this nut  for a few more ideas check out the note belowOnce the liquids cooled down C is ok remove pat with a paper towel and dry for  minutes  If thiss still wet when we toss it in the oven it can inhibit browning Im a bit paranoid on that front so I keep it out drying on a rack for  minutesOptional dice the excess lamb fat then render it by frying together with  tbsp of of sunflower oil over mediumlow heat Render out however much oil you like  I usually go a full  minutes because the leftover lamb cracklins are like my dogs alltime favorite food Or if you have a particularly fatty cut of lamb feel free to start the process in water just as if you were rendering lard If youve got extra fat melted lamb fat is a great thing to drizzle over cous cousToast the sesame seeds Nice thing to have around In a dry wokskillet over medium low heat toast the sesame seeds for  minutes or until they begin to brown slightly Make a big batch When it comes to stuff hanging around your pantry toasted sesame seeds gt untoasted sesame seedsMake the spice rub in a coffee or spice grinder grind the fennel seed into a fine powder grind the cumin seed for  seconds Thoroughly crush the MSG in a mortar lightly crush the sesame seeds to release a bit of oil Mix together For the half ground cumin seeds youre looking for something like thishttpsiimgurcomkjwNNRtpng and for the sesame seeds youre looks for something about this consistencyhttpsiimgurcomobXtzpngMassage the oil into the nowdry lamb ribs followed by the seasoining Get your hands dirty do a bang up job getting every inch Marinate for at least  minutes and up to over night Preferably marinate overnight Seems to work wellPreheat oven to C Roast for  minutes turning halfway through Serve with seasoned chili flakes Why C Mostly because its the max our crappy little halogen oven can do so thats what we tested Check out the note below on roasting alternativesNote on poaching alternativesSo a big help in nailing down this recipe was our local beeflamb butcher whos from Gansu Chinese sources are even frustratingly touch and go for this dish For him he does a straight simmer for  minutes Like get the water hot turn down the flame toss it in and simmer  That methods good too and would probably be the more authentic way to go about the dish That said when we tried that in our tests the lean part of the chop got that whole dryyetsoft quality that you sometimes find if you simmer meats without much fatcollagen for a long time eg the lean pork used to flavor Cantonese soups The ribs were perfect though So If you wanted to do that Id probably drop the chops in with  minutes to go or so to make sure they dont overcookThe thing was I really wanted to mimic the roast lamb ribs that we get at the very best Xinjiang restaurant in the city The cold water start method was much much closer to the super soft texture that theyve got going on at that restaurant there so thats what we went withAnother pretty famous lamb restaurant in Shenzhen uses a pressure cooker for their stuff Im  sure I remember a post on Baidu Zhidao the Chinese equivalent of Quora where cook from a restaurant that did roast lamb said they did  minutes in a pressure cooker Cant seem to find the post right now If using a pressure cooker try  minutes at firstAlternatively sous vide might be another decent choice especially if youre working from lamb chops I personally dont own a sous vide but I think Id go for C medium well then finish the lamb roastingNote on roasting

He's having a new house built soon as wanted help designing his kitchen, so I gave him some tips on layout and architecture but then we moved on to stocking it. This tends to be my wheelhouse because I could easily write an entire book with all of my opinions and preferences on kitchen tools. So in an attempt to essentially ask which tools he should invest the most in, he posed a really interesting question. He said:

520,cu1nmk,Proper way to marinade/cook chicken breast?,"Ok so I buy fresh chicken breast, add my spices/seasoning to the chicken so its coated all over and leave it in the fridge for a couple hours

Then I cook the chicken in the oven for around 15 minutes, on a bed of tinfoil to keep my trays clean, but when I take it out the chicken is in a pool of watery liquid and tastes vaguely like a hint of the spices/flavouring I use, and its the same wether I use sauce or powdered seasoning.

What am i doing wrong?

Should I butterfly or dice the chicken first? Marinade longer? Fry instead of oven cook? Should I completely wrap the chicken in tinfoil rather than leaving it exposed?

The one thing I'm seeing others do that I haven't yet tried is using a water bath, but before I try that I'd like some confirmation that it will make any difference. Naively, I'd think there's no relevant interactions between the water outside and the sugar at the very bottom and even if the water provided a closer and more homogeneous heat source, the thing would still harden by the time it goes into the fridge.

576,ctxfyj,All-clad on a budget?,"Hello everyone, Looking for advice on the best way to go about this. My entire life I’ve been using cheap hand-me-downs  and other various other pieces of low quality cookware (thin single ply). I was recently inspired by some reading I did to make an investment in decent cookware now that I’m 30 (and not on a college student budget), and almost every review seems to point to all-clad as the gold standard by which others are judged. 

It doesn’t necessarily need to be all-clad, but if it’s relevant I cook on a ceramic glass cooktop and really what I think I’m after is even heating with the lowest chance of warping over time (my current pots wobble like crazy on the ceramic cooktop). I came across made-in and they seem very intriguing and the price point is about what I’m aiming for. However cookinglight said in their review that the skillets were not flat out of the box and warped even more with use so that was concerning. 

I purchased the all-clad D5 10 Pc set from Williams and Sonoma for $640, it’s still sitting in the box until I decide to keep them or not. My wife experienced some sticker shock, even though I tried to argue that this was a lifetime purchase and the actual cost of ownership was low :). I feel the set is well balanced and liked that it had a 4 qt sauté pan instead of the 3qt that the d3 set comes with, the only piece I probably wouldn’t use is the 8” skillet...Then I heard about people scoring All-Clad for low prices at the tjx stores, so I went hunting at the stores around me. What I came across there:

-	D5 8 QT stockpot w/lid   $120 (perfect condition)
-	D5 2 QT saucepan w/lid  $100 (tiny bulge on the inside where the bottom meets the side, doesn’t show from the outside so not sure how that happened unless the layers are separated)
-	D3 3 QT sauté pan w/lid  $80 (perfect condition)
-	D3 3 QT saucepan w/lid $80 (perfect condition)
-	CopperCore 5 QT sauté pan w/lid  $150 (perfect condition)
-	CopperCore 8 QT stockpot w/lid $170 (small dent on the side, so this would probably be discounted a bit more at checkout)
-	D5 10” fry pan $90 (had some small gauging in the middle of the pan so I ruled it out”
-	D3  “Armor” 8” fry pan $50

I began to realize at this rate I would end up spending nearly as much as I had on the set from W/S if I wanted similar pieces, probably because the coppercore pieces are much more expensive than say the D3. D3 seems to be the sweet spot at these stores, d5 seems to run around $100/piece unless it lasts long enough to go on clearance). Also I’m not sure if the warranty still applies on these pieces, couldn’t find an answer on that.

I have no idea if it’s true or not but in theory it seems like with the on/off nature of ceramic tops the D5 would hold a steadier temp than the D3 with its extra steel layer due to lower responsiveness. Possibly also more resistant to warping. 

Would you recommend keeping the W/S set at that price, keep hunting at the tjx stores or just go with a different brand altogether?

591,ctlo79,"Dear Reddit, Help me learn"," 

Hi, Forgive me as I've never done this before and I think this is my first post on reddit?

I have a issue.. I'm a adult who's disabled who doesn't know how to cook, Like.. I can't even make mac &amp; cheese correctly..

When I was in school I was never taught how to do any of this, so I am now turning to you for help...

Here's my issues in the kitchen

1. I find it extremely hard to understand/comprehend most box instructions, I find it missing info or poorly written in some cases, lets take mac and cheese for example.. I got to the drain the noodle part and then I put it back in the pot and still had the stove on, according to my roomie that was wrong and the stove should have went off, No where on the box did its a say to stop heating/cooking.. it also didn't bother to say how much butter or milk goes into it, no tbspoons nothing.. just guess work
2. I can't honestly tell what is tender/crisp etc.. or how to tell/taste those sort of things, It may have because I was never exposed to this skill set and people just cooked for me most of my life and I just ate what i liked without knowing how to tell what apart..
3. with my ADHD/comprehensions disorder I Find it extremely hard to pay attention to stirring without wanting to sit down or go do something else

I know cooking may not be for everyone but this is something I need to learn to do and overcome, The kitchen scares me and has always been on bad terms with it throughout my life (from catching a pot of water on fire some how) I understand being disabled it is a bit harder for me then the average joe.. that's why I have finally decided to seek help

I need to be taught in a creative way not the normal ""lets learn how to cook the basics way"" as this may be the only way I can learn, I'm good with visuals instead of words, so Photos explaining what certain things are etc might help, A video that over complicate things wont help me all that much. I know this is asking allot but

614,ctkvu6,"I want to bake a chocolate cake, but I don't have any baking powder. Help.","I found a recipe for a very delicious looking chocolate cake, and I would like to try and make it. All I have is baking soda. Does anyone have a good cake recipe that on only calls for baking soda and no baking powder? 

I have flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, sugar, and eggs. I also have brown sugar, powdered sugar, and sour cream. I'd like to use sour cream in my batter as well. I normally like to just mess around and see how the product comes out, as that's the fun of it for me, but this time I would like to just have some darn cake and I kind of want to surprise my husband after work. I also don't have anything to sift my flour/cocoa powder so some advice to incorporate those as smoothly as possible would be great as well. 

If anyone has a recipe for brownies as well, that would also be cool, but I want cake a bit more this evening. I really appreciate any advice you all may have, and I will definitely update with how it comes out.

Edit: I do not have cream of tartar to make my own baking powder substitute.

Edit 2: I have decided that I want to try and see how the acidity from sour cream along with slightly decreasing the amount of baking soda and whipping the egg whites will affect the cake.

627,csztgw,Hot pepper hands - solution!,"Most of the time I don't have a problem cutting up hot peppers with my bare hands, so I rarely wear gloves unless I am processing a lot of peppers. Every couple of years I regret that choice (and after yesterday will always wear gloves- 6 or 7 peppers did me in!).

Got hot pepper hands yesterday and tried detergent, vinegar and oil to scrub my hands, to no avail. I don't ever have dairy around so couldn't try that.

I gave up &amp; decided to just wait it out, but then had to do some nasty cleaning in a tent and used hand sanitizer to clean my hands.

And it *stopped the burn* almost completely, first application. I had used the sanitizer &amp; then rinsed it off because I don't really like that stuff much. 

When I realized it had helped so much, I put more on, but it didn't help at first- I think because it was a different brand of sanitizer, but also because I didn't rinse it off. I added more, scrubbed my hands until it was starting to dry, then rinsed it off. There were a couple of spots that needed a third go around, but instead of facing 2-3 days of burning hands, I am totally fine!

I have tried all of the weird ass internet solutions, but this is the only thing that has really solved the problem. I think the combination of alcohol (dissolves the capsaicin) &amp; glycerin (acts like oil &amp; binds to capsaicin) in the sanitizer is probably what works, but I am not a chemist, so not sure.

First- USE GLOVES. Don't worry that people will think you are a wuss, just do it, even if some jerk in the kitchen is making fun of you. Don't tell yourself that peppers hardly ever hurt you so you don't need gloves, because you'll end up with a batch that slays you.

638,cta6ud,"What are your best suggestions for an outdoor summer potluck dish, that ANYONE would eat?","I have a small block party this Friday to bring a dish to, and I’m not resorting to making my (admittedly very tasty) lime fluff recipe for the millionth time this season.

I’m curious what your best potluck/BBQ recipes are!  Primarily the ones that even the most-picky-of-eaters would love, since the problem I often run into is never not making enough, but having to take home leftovers because my flavor palate =/= most of my neighbor’s flavor palates.

Based on an oldie but a goodie, my take on-

**Lime Fluff**

Ingredients:

(*This is makes A LOT of fluff* for “family sized” and not “party sized”, halve the recipe!)

1 six-ounce package of lime jello

1 eight-ounce tub of (thawed) cool whip

2 fifteen-ounce cans of diced/cubed mango (don’t drain)

1 sixteen-ounce container sour cream

1/2 - 1 sixteen-ounce container cottage cheese (add more or less depending on your taste, sometimes I omit the cottage cheese completely for certain crowds and it still turns out fine)

1 full sixteen-ounce bag of mini marshmallows (I don’t care for the colorful ones, but any kind should work)

1 1/2 cups slivered almonds

Juice + zest of one lime

Directions:

Literally just combine everything in one bowl, preferably with a lid;  add 1/2 the amount of zest and taste to make sure it isn’t overpowering, add more to taste.  You can also add more lime juice if you have it on hand to taste, I like mine quite tart!

Mix it very well, and cover with the lid/plastic wrap and let chill in the fridge for at least one hour.  It should set up and be very light and airy.  Even if it melts a bit, put it back in the fridge and it should recover.

652,ctcap6,Ideas for Oven/Sous Vide Smoked Brisket/Pastrami? (Apartment no smoker),"Alright guys I'm currently carrying out this experiment in my oven right now with Prime 18 lb brisket and 2 racks of Chuck Short Ribs.

TL;DR Dry brine with Smoked Salt, a bit of pink curing salt. Follow up with liquid smoke glaze thickened with molasses and add your rub. Oven 170 check on it 12+ hours later for tenderness. Rambling below.

So I've read Kenji's Sous Vide Brisket article and I believe I may have attempted it in the past(it's been a while, could've been Chef's Steps Version, both are 155 degrees).

I have reasons to believe it may be easier and superior to use an oven that can go as low as 170 over Sous Vide at 155(If going for 135 definitely use Sous Vide).

My reasoning is that big hunk of meat=smaller temp swings even though the oven cycles. Uncovered it should on average idle lower than the oven temp. I've experimented in the past with short ribs and brisket if not covered and it would reach in the 150s or 160s.

From my experiments one could use an average oven to roast or braise anywhere from the 150-190s.

Issue with Sous Vide for tough cuts is just because you did Temp X Hrs doesn't mean your tough cut is done cooking. It's tough to probe(I guess you can if you used zip lock bags) and to get a feel to see if it done you need asbestos hands to squeeze it or see how flexible it is.

Just synthesizing some ideas from ChefSteps Smokerless Brisket and Kenji's Serious Eats articles on Corned Beef and Sous Vide Brisket.

So I think a take away is that Dry Curing or Dry seasoning is superior to wet curing. Reading ChefSteps article on Equilibrium Brining says that for a wet cure they use 2-4% salt by total weight water + meat. When I calculate salt% for dry curing/brine for the brisket and corned beef articles from Serious Eats it ranges from 3-5% however I suspect that not all the salt is used and one is just meant to liberally coat the meat, maybe a bit more aggressively if going for corned beef or pastrami.

So some ideas. Use a smoked salt of your choice cut with pink curing salt and season to cover for a few hours for the brisket or go ham and season assertively for the pastrami and wait the 7 days. ChefSteps uses a glaze made from liquid smoke, molasses and soy sauce as a way to make rub adhere better and add smoke.

For simple brisket I guess you can add a mixture of smoked salt and coarsely ground pepper or the ChefSteps rub with chipotle peppers, mustard, pepper, brown sugar, onion and garlic powder and smoked salt.

Or when your pastrami is done dry curing glaze it and use a pastrami or corned beef rub?

Feel free comment or critique some of my ideas. All I know is that short ribs and brisket come out amazing if you're patient and probe or assess for texture. I got some prime brisket and short ribs to experiment with. I'll be back with my results.

660,ct9pb1,How do you know when cooking meat at low heat and it’s tough if it’s done or needs more time?,"I made Serious Eats oven cooked ribs tonight: 2 hours at 250 wrapped in foil and then an additional 1.5 hours without the foil followed by broiling for 5-10 mins. So at the 3.5 hour mark you’re supposed to pierce the meat and see if it’s met with “minimal resistance.”   I pierce. It goes through ok but doesn’t slide through as there is some resistance I suppose. And here’s my question: at this point, are  the ribs overcooked or do they need more time in the oven? 

I know that low and slow cooking needs an extended amount of time for the cartilage to break down. So after a lot of back and forth I decide to put them back in the oven for 15 mins. Take them out, no difference. It’s soft but with a bit of a chew to it. I’m worried about over cooking them so just proceed on with the broiler step.

682,ct5e3c,Cookware,"Hello, fellow cooks &amp; chefs.  It's getting to be time to replace my cookware.  I started out on Amazon looking at sets and reading only the negative reviews.  The logic behind this is that if I know what the downsides are it helps to filter out inevitable issues later down the line.  For example, one brand consistently talked about how the pan lasts 6-9 months at best and the manufacturer refuses to honor the lifetime guarantee.  I'd prefer to avoid this kind of issue but it seems that there's some kind of issue with every type of nonstick pan.   
I know stainless steel is best but I burn everything to it.  I don't mean to but it happens. For that reason I'd prefer to use nonstick but then that comes with its own risks and downsides.  
Two years ago there was a similar post in r/Cooking about cookware and the recommended brands are mostly stainless steel.  All Clad was the brand that was consistently recommended.  I looked into it and did a slow exhale at the price.  I feel like I'll have to compromise somewhere unless someone can recommend a miracle pot/pan brand?  Most days I have enough things going on the stove to use all three saucepans and a skillet at the same time so buying just one good skillet and saucepan isn't going to be enough.    


Please don't attack me for this question- I already said I'm aware I'll probably have  to make a sacrifice in my expectations but I'm at least looking for a good nonstick solution.

For example, I like to make meatballs in the morning and put them in the fridge until I'm ready to make dinner in the evening . I put them on a pan and place plastic wrap over them as to not contaminate anything else. Could I use something else instead? A paper towel perhaps?

Going to be blunt. The end product just lacks any chicken flavor and is kind of bland. I was being kind of lazy and skipped over using an onion and didn’t have any garlic. I also didn’t put the non edible bits inside that, as far as I know, give it more flavor because I wanted to keep the vegetables inside to eat later.

0,61bcic,/r/AskCulinary best practices guide,"/r/AskCulinary is well over 100,000 subscribers now (!!!), so we felt like it’s a good time to review some best practices for everyone here.

#Guidelines for questions:
1.	**The search bar and the FAQ are both woefully underused.** Please give your question a quick search before asking. There’s a good chance it has already been addressed already (especially if it pertains to cast iron, steak, or knife sharpening). Providing the same answers over and over again gets kind of dull don't you think?
2.	If you’re asking for help with a recipe or would like to tweak a recipe, **please provide a link to the recipe**. It’s hard to give you advice if we don’t know what you’re already doing!
3.	**Equipment recommendations**: Most of the time, these questions devolve into subjective suggestions rather than objective observations: “I’ve only used this brand, I’ve never touched any of the others, but it works great, therefore I recommend it without having any knowledge of the other brands!” Also, we have lots of detailed answers about popular equipment topics in our aforementioned [woefully underused FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/equipmentfaqs). 
4.	**Food safety**: General food safety questions are permitted, but specific questions concerning the specific dish that you left out on the counter for x hours, or if your chicken is still safe after it's been defrosting in the fridge for x days will generally be removed.
5.	**Recipe requests**: Recipe requests are best served at /r/recipes or /r/cooking. In general, if you’re looking for a lot of “correct” answers (like for a recipe request), /r/cooking is the place to go.
6.	**General discussion**: Again, questions like “what’s your favorite…” which feature many “correct” answers are better served over in /r/cooking. However, we feature one general discussion each week, so if you have an idea for a discussion topic, please send it our way.

And here are some examples of good and not so good questions for /r/askculinary.

**Bad questions**:  
• “I accidentally left my bacon out for five hours! Is it still safe to eat?” (Rule 4)    
• “Give me your favorite hash brown recipes!” (Rule 5)    
• “Do Michelin starred restaurants ever use ketchup?” (Rule 6)    

**Good questions**:  
• “Planning a multi-course romantic dinner. Critique my menu please?""  
• “How do I fix the cracks on my macarons?”  
• “What kinds of modifications would I need to make if I used instant yeast instead of active dry in my bread recipe?”  
• “Here’s my falafel recipe. Why do they keep falling apart in the fryer?”  

#Guidelines for answers:
1.	**Questions at all levels are welcome**. Please be helpful when answering a question. Beginners never improve if they get downvotes and flaming instead of advice.   
2.	**Please keep answers pertinent to the question asked**. For instance, telling OP that they should have used pork shoulder when they already have a pot of dry slow cooked pork loin is not of much help is it? Rather than just telling OP that they’ve screwed up, offer advice for future improvement, but also try to present a solution that addresses their problem at hand.  
3.	**Many problems in the kitchen have more than one right answer**. Your method may not the one true way to make pizza or hot wings or whatever!   
4.	Lastly, **be nice**! Politeness is not optional here in /r/askculinary.

It didn't necessarily make it any heavier per se, but added a little tackiness and mouthfeel I was looking for that you would traditionally get from the collagen from bone reduction.

So if anyone could answer one or all of these questions, that would be awesome. I know I could just experiment, but it takes days to finish a dough, and I'm still not even great at stretching and successfully completing a pizza so a little help would be great.

1. What differences can one expect as dough hydration goes up? Easier to work with? More flexible? Different texture upon finishing? Anything like that?
2. What happens the more you knead dough? Will it be easier to work with later when you come back to it? What will be the differences in the final product? What happens when you knead TOO much, and is there any way to tell? I know about the window-pane test, just wondering what happens when you take it too far.
3. I've heard that you shouldn't really use strong flour in a home oven. Can anyone elaborate on this? What difference will I find if I make a pizza with all purpose, vs king arthur bread flour, vs some kind of caputo stronger flour, vs the strongest of flours?
4. Letting it sit in the fridge 1 day vs 2..3..4? vs just letting it sit on the counter for a few hours and making it the same day?

23,cbknjo,How come people were willing to kill each other in the past over delicious foods? Even as far as mere condiments like food spices? Was food that terrible back than?,"I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......

A bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.

In addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

1. Use a juicer to make a liquid from the blueberry, mint, and lemon.

2. Make a pudding base from sugar, whole milk, corn starch, egg yolks, and a little salt.

3. Mix the juicer liquid with the pudding base.

4. Place everything mixed together on medium heat, and stir occasionally. About 5 min or so. The pudding is suppose to thicken a little bit, but it never does for me.

5. Turn stovetop to medium heat, and continuously mix pudding for another 5 min. At this point the pudding should have a stiffer texture, but mine never does.

I've recently separated for good from my wife, while times have been tough, i've realized I have a whole world I'm able to go see now.   


I'm specifically interested in working aboard luxury yachts as a chef. I'm taking this year to regroup mentally and physically, and train my culinary arts so by next summer I can be skillful enough in all areas to work aboard a yacht.   


Background on my skill set: I've worked in all types of kitchens. I owned my own burger place for a while.   


I worked in a breakfast and lunch place, we made everything from scratch of course (stocks, ketchup, breads, etc). While I didn't learn breads, I received pastry training here. I specialized in macarons, and basically anything out of the advanced professional pastry chef.  


I've worked in country clubs, where we made variety of pasta's, steaks, basic country club foods.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked at a pizza place, made the dough, sauce, etc from scratch.   


Am I qualified enough? What i'm worried about is my experience with seafood. I'm very limited on sushi and breaking down of fish. Being from the midwest, you don't have many high end places with fresh seafood. But i'm confident I know enough to teach myself over the next year if that's doable.

96,cad5m8,Where exactly do I measure the temperature in the oven?,"I am having trouble baking, with certain recipes not turning out or not turning out as well as they should. I follow recipes to the letter, use the prescribed ingredients and temperature. I thought my oven's thermostat is faulty so I bought an oven thermometer, and then it hit me: I don't know WHAT oven temperature means!

So please, explain to me, what exactly should I do when I'm prescribed something along the lines of:

*""Preheat oven to 190 degrees. Bake at 190 degrees for 10 minutes, then at 180 degrees for 20 more minutes""*

Here's my oven's picture, baking some eclairs. I have an oven stone, which supposedly makes the temperature more stable, plus I bake pizza and certain other breads on it. I don't seem to have image attachment rights so here's a link  [https://imgur.com/I1f2XJk](https://imgur.com/I1f2XJk)

I marked specific spots in the oven with numbers I will reference below.

**My specific questions are:**

**a) When told to preheat the oven to 190, where should the temperature reach 190 degrees exactly?**

Is it at (1), at the back of the oven's center, where the oven's thermostat is located?

Is it at (2), at the baking tray where I'll place whatever I'll bake?

Is it at (3), this is a point in the air but close to heat source (the stone)

Is it at (4), the stone itself (measured with an infrared thermometer in this case)?

**b)** **Should I preheat the baking tray, then take it out, quickly place the goods, and put it back in?**

Or am I expected to put in a cold, room temperature baking tray? It seems the latter should be the case right?

**c) Does the recipe account for the fact that the temperature drops after putting the goods in?**

After you preheat your oven, then put in something big, like a 1kg cake, the oven's temperature will drop both from the cake itself being cold, and from being opened for about 10 seconds to put the cake in, however, since oven's thermostat is at the back of the oven, it won't register this, as the oven's back wall won't get much cooler. Therefore, the oven won't increase its fire, because it doesn't feel like it's gotten cold, while in effect, the cake is in a way lower temperature than desired? Do I preheat the oven to higher than target temperature to account for the temperature drop when goods are put in? Or do the recipes usually account for that?

**d) Where should the temperature be at 190 degrees during baking?**

So, assuming I preheat to 190, meaning, the thermometer at (3) shows 190 and thermostat at (1) shows 190 and the stone (4) shows a temperature of 190, and change nothing afterwards (the knob stays where it was to achieve 190), after I open the oven, put the tray with eclairs inside, and shut the oven, the measurements (in practice) are as follows: the temperature at (2) (near the eclairs themselves) is like 110 or something, the temperature at (3) drops to about 165 and then very slowly (over the period of 5 minutes) climbs to 180 or something and stays there. If I increase the oven's fire (set target temperature to like 220), by the time temperature at (3) is at 190 again, the temperature of the stone (4) is like 210 to 240, and the temperature at (3) is still like 130 or something. Temperature at (3) barely reaches 190 ever, unless I keep the knob at maximum setting, at which point (3) shows values like 230 or 240, and the stone (4) is 250 or higher.

So where should it be equal to 190, if it is told to be 190? Where do I measure it? How do I achieve it?

**e)** **How do I change temperature to 180 after 10 minutes, if told to do so, and again, where do I measure it?**

Do I just remove oven's fire by turning the knob off? And wait? Do I set the oven's knob to 180? Do I open the door for 10 seconds to let it cool? If I just turn the knob to 180 there's no effect - the fire was already at minimum and stays there.

103,cafsdn,Help making a really simple tomato base / ketchup for primarily vinegar based BBQ sauces,"I’ve been trying to replicate a sauce I had a few years ago by first making every vinegar BBQ sauce recipe I can find, then hopefully starting from the most similar one and working towards the end product.  All of these sauces are like 85-95% vinegar, but the vast majority of them call for a few tablespoons of ketchup, which I’d rather not do — I want much finer control over what’s going into the sauce.  So I’m looking to make a simple ketchup-like sauce with minimal spices (as I’ll be adding all the spices I need to the actual BBQ sauce when I’m making it).  The thing is, everything I’ve tried is just weird, and I’m hoping I don’t have to overcomplicate the ingredients to make it more neutral tasting.  

The closest thing I’ve tried looks dead-on and the consistency is perfect, but the taste is pretty odd to me.  

3/4c white vinegar

3/4c white sugar

3/4c water

1/4c tomato paste

1/2tsp onion powder

1/2tsp garlic powder

&amp;nbsp;

Whisk together in an oven-safe pot, cover with foil (or a lid I guess), and toss into a 250f oven for five hours.  Re-whisk and reduce if need-be.  The color and texture are perfect but the taste definitely seems wrong for BBQ sauce.  I think it needs to be more subtle — it’s super strong in every department, plus acidic and a little hard to describe.  

I’m using the oven to keep it from burning, as I’ve done too many times on the stove top.  Iterating through different ratios and recipes is pretty time consuming because of that.  

Is there a particular ratio or recipe you think might work better?

135,ca1mt6,(Several Questions) Titanium Wok? Good pots &amp; pans? Induction Cooktop? Working with a non vented range?,"My wife and I are getting our first place so we're naturally considering what to do for the kitchen. With such said I grew up in a melting pot so Asian cooking is pretty normal and my wife doesn't cook but wants to learn.

(**Edit!** I now understand a Wok needs a LOT of heat.  But they use it in a less traditional fashion in Hong Kong and so I'd like to grab one regardless for frying, and general cooking as they do)

The in-laws say (translated it likely titanium) they bought a titanium wok 20+ years ago and I see them occasionally for sale. They say that stuff doesn't stick to it easily, that it's lasted forever, and is a good buy.

However, I am not sure if these claims are true or if what they're using is in fact titanium. It's certainly not stainless but that's all I really know, and I'd like to buy the best wok I can within reason ($200 tops).  Perhaps a hard anodized wok is the best bet?

Past this premise for the usual North American pots and pans--which brands/models (Calphalon? Is Cuisinart OK?) can last several decades and are stainless steel ?

Is there a favored brand/model of toaster oven? I would go with say Zojirushi (not sure if they even make one but in that $130-$200 price range)) as we're impressed with the ricecooker (it's worth it!) but are unsure what a good buy is in the states.

Lastly the apartment has a non vented range hood which is unfortunate and cannot be changed...

Has anyone experimented with an air purifier or other means to mitigate smoke and the like?

Strawberry blueberry vodka, and mango cantaloupe vodka. Strawberry blueberry vodka tasted great, though not so much like blueberry as the strawberry was olverwhelming. Mango cantaloupe tasted much milder, there was a color change but not too much of a differential in flavor.

I'm wondering a couple things and hoping you can help me out.

1) Is there a resource I can use to say ""If I have X alcohol, use Y and Z ingredients"". Like cherry mint vodka or jalapeno lime tequila...

2) How will I know what flavors will infuse well? Can I tell just by looking at the material? Why does mango retain its flavor but strawberry extracts?

**Steel? -** Open (details below)

**Grip? -** Pinch

**Handle? -** Japanese

**Length? -** 210mm

**Use cases? -** Mostly fruit, vegetable, and herb preparation. Lots of chopping and mincing. Occasionally used to chop up cooked meat or filet raw meat.

**Care? -** I'd like to learn how to sharpen my knife based on the type of knife it is and its construction.

**Budget? -** $100 or less (must be aval on Amazon) 

I've been cooking a lot lately, so I figured it's time to rip the bandage and get a proper chef's knife. I'm very excited! My technique involves a pinch grip with a rocking/pushing motion instead of a straight chop. 

I currently use a $4 western style knife from Walmart that is *very* handle-heavy, quite thick, double bevel, and is curved at the blade. My issue is that it tends to get stuck in potatoes and onions, it doesn't feel comfortable for fine work, and it just feels kind of heavy and clunky.

For these reasons I *think* I'm looking for a Japanese style knife. I'm looking for something that feels light and agile, can slice through fruits and vegetables with ease, and something I can have fine control over.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for in terms of material, shape, bevel, etc. I hope you can give me options with case by case examples. I appreciate the belly of the knife because it accommodates the rocking/pushing motion I'm used to, but I'm early enough in my learning process that I'd be willing to try a new style of knife even if it meant adapting my technique.

I've heard so many different approaches to this particular question that i decided to ask here and see what the most widely accepted consensus is

So far the option that i seem to like the most is to ""Nest"" the pasta into the typical nests that one see in the supermarket and leave them in a container in the fridge (Not the freezer) for the next day

However, a couple of questions raise when thinking about said procedure, like:

Should i leave the pasta strands rest and or semi-dry prior to nesting? If so, For how long?

Wouldn't the nest stick during its stage in the freezer? Thus, sticking during the boiling stage?

Is it necessary for the container to be Air-Tight?

Another suggestion was to just leave the strands hanging over night in the kitchen, would this work? I feel like they would get really stiff and maybe break when tossed around(??)Feel free to debunk/confirm that))

285,c6uebl,"Need help replicating a recipe, relative with autism is very upset over discontinued soup.","A close family member of mine has been obsessed with a Lemon Chicken and Rice soup from Luna Grill for the past couple of years. 

I have googled and googled and tried various recipes, but most just use a canned broth or stock, and the soup comes out too brownish and clear. 

The broth is a fairly opaque yellow, I know for certain it contains some diced onion that are cooked in the broth long enough to be transparent and they dissolve on your tongue. I am pretty sure the rice in the soup is basmati. 

The broth is on the salty side, but consistently so over multiple bowls, so I'm suspecting that given this is a ”fast casual” style restaurant it's not scratch made, but I could be wrong on that. 

The chicken pieces themselves are white meat, and they have most of the lemon flavor. The outside of each piece is yellow, but when bit in half the yellow only coats the chicken. It's a similar yellow to scrambled eggs. 

When chilled, a few little fat bubbles collect on the surface and they are more orange. I suspect there's egg yolk to give a richness, but I'm having a hell of a time finding a recipe close enough that my autistic relative can't tell it's different. 

I have written the company, since the Texas stores are no longer serving the soup, but they were unwilling to share it since it's still served in their California stores.

Instead, he really pushed these stone crab legs he had on me. He gave me a huge discount and I pretty much agreed to buy it (though I won't be stopping by to pay/pick it up until later today). I was kind of skeptical, so he had me try one and it was pretty dull but definitely edible. Now, given that it's wayyy out of season, do you think I would be crazy/stupid/unethical to buy it? I just don't fully understand how he has stone crab claws in the end of June, while also so desperate to get rid of it.

Also, he said he's going to freeze them for me since I won't be serving until Sunday (if that means anything).

With all of the recent hype about organic, local, fair trade, etc in food communities, why aren’t companies like [this](https://www.mmcsc.org/) more popular?  Or are they so niche that I don't realize that they're popular?

336,c614s9,Anatomy of a culinary failure (split pea soup),"I just started working with split peas as a home cook this week. It amazes me that I can be in my late twenties and not know certain seemingly basic things! First, I had to research exactly what they are. Then, I decided to make a soup out of them from *American Wholefoods Cuisine* by the Goldbecks. It looks like a great book... and I must have screwed something up. Well, I know I screwed up one thing royally... more on that later. Here's the recipe: 

* 2 cups dried split peas
* 8 cups water
* 2 onions, chopped
* 4 carrots, chopped
* 4 to 6 leafy celery tops, chopped
* 1 large bay leaf
* 2 teaspoons salt
* pepper

So here is my list of things that did go wrong / could have gone wrong:

* I didn't sort or wash the beans before use. I know! Terrible. Won't do that again.

* Some scum formed quickly on the top of the soup. I didn't take it out. I'm reading that this probably didn't affect the flavor, but I will remove it next time. 

* When the beans had cooked for only forty minutes, they turned into a mush with some of the bean bodies left intact. I'm guessing this was due to too much heat: the recipe says to bring the ingredients to a boil then cook over low heat. How do I know when this kind of thing is at the right kind of boil, though?

* The recipes calls for ""celery tops""... What the heck does this mean exactly? Do you want lots of leaves and some of the stalk, or what?

* If I can fix the problems with it, I'd like to try adding in some ham and yogurt and dill, and pureeing the whole thing. Any tips on that? It's from a veg cookbook, but I'd like to try this after I get the original right.

My wife and I used to live in an apartment with no kitchen ventilation and I knew it was a useless battle, so I'd just open up the windows and disable my smoke detectors. We have grown older, more responsible, and with child, so this is no longer the case.

We have also moved to a nicer place. It's pretty small (~850 sq. ft), but one of the upgrades I made sure of was a hood over the stove. I ended up with a [Frigidaire over the range microwave/vent combo](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Frigidaire-30-in-1-6-cu-Ft-Over-the-Range-Microwave-in-Stainless-Steel-FFMV1645TS/301400202?cm_mmc=Shopping%7CG%7CBase%7CD29A%7CMulti%7CMulti%7CLIA%7CMajor-Appliances%7CSpecial-Buys%7c71700000032418576%7c58700003842368110%7c92700034747564111&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjMfoBRDDARIsAMUjNZos9jcq0MK_rSuzSPf9zHSAOAejm961wxdrqU_lT0ngP92yPCPbDDEaAo54EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). It's hooked up to an external wall with a tube that vents outside. It's all new and seems to be installed well. The new kitchen also has a great gas range with a pretty intense power burner for a home kitchen. I love it.

Another change is [hardwired smoke detectors](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kidde-Hardwire-Smoke-and-Carbon-Monoxide-Combination-Detector-with-AA-Battery-Backup-Voice-Alarm-and-Ionization-Sensor-21026041/301683362?cm_mmc=Shopping%7CG%7CBase%7CD27E%7C27-5_SAFETY-SECURITY%7CNA%7CPLA%7CFireSafety%7c71700000034238978%7c58700003943782706%7c92700031956830974&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjMfoBRDDARIsAMUjNZpP12nuS0ijmg4dE0fcq1shPfuCXGT56Z_AxicufhxkVFA5UcB2W4saAgoDEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds). They have an override feature, but it only lasts half an hour and will still sound the alarm in ""heavily smoky"" conditions.

Also, like I said... more responsible and with child, so the smoke detectors are staying on.

I thought the microwave/vent combo would be our lifesaver. The first time I flipped the fan on high and began searing a steak, of course, the smoke detectors started blaring within a minute. I hit the override feature, but it was still quickly too much and the alarms tripped again.

I've since started opening up all of the windows. There's a nice cross breeze going through most of the house. I keep a fan on near each smoke detector. Air conditioning/heat be damned. When I'm gonna cook some meat, my family is just gonna sweat/freeze it out.

Under these conditions, I can get maybe 6 minutes of good sear time on a pork tenderloin roast before it overwhelms the smoke detectors' override feature and the alarm *still* wakes up our neighborhood.

I don't have a ton of money to spend on kitchen upgrades. We're not moving anywhere soon. I like to sear steaks. I like to make roasts. I even like to go crazy and pan fry blackened catfish in a bunch of butter and oil in my cast iron skillet, but there's no way that's happening with this setup.

376,c5kfqz,Can someone help me fill in the gap about what I don't know about creaming fat and sugar?,"As I've been baking and researching about baking I've come confused about what the sugar is actually doing when it gets creamed into the fat (I'm not sure if I even used the term ""cream"" correctly there). I do understand that when you cream the sugar and fat you are creating air pockets, which give the space that leaveners use to expand in. People's advice on techniques for this that I've come across is what is confusing me. 

America's Test Kitchen's (ATK) research says that using chilled butter that is defined as 60-65 degrees F or when pressed with a finger leaves a crack is superior in leavening or creating those air pockets than butter at room temp, which is about 70 degrees F or there is no crack in the butter when pressed with a finger. They also showed what happens when you use melted butter. What was shown was that as the butter loses its solid nature it becomes harder to create those air pockets. In my mind I akin the butter to the substance that is the wall that surrounds the air and as that gets less solid it gets increasingly difficult to trap air or create air pockets. What makes butter special is that it has these “beta-prime” crystals that are just the right size versus the larger ones found in lard, which is apparently too large to hold in the air. They also point out that as you beat the butter the temperature of it will rise a few degrees. If I wanted to be safe I would definitely be going for the low 60’s in butter temp. 

To concur with ATK, I have Milk Bar’s cookbook and Tossi goes on about creaming the butter and sugar. She goes the extra mile and does it longer than most people intuitively would. I think it was 7 minutes, which is basically the time ATK uses for their pound cake recipe. However, when ATK cream the butter and sugar for their lemon bundt cake it’s only for three minutes and they don’t care much about temperature of the egg other than it should be room temperature. Whilst in the pound cake you need to beat the eggs before hand and then gradually add them in and beat for an additional 3-4 minutes. I only note these eggs instructions parts because they say since it’s more difficult to incorporate a colder egg into the creamed butter and sugar you can actually break the air pockets in that time versus using room temperature eggs. If I were to believe what is going on here you’d want to be more careful with more delicate cakes like pound cake that doesn’t rely on chemical leaveners. 

Here’s where things get tricky for me. If I were to apply these principles would it be fair to say that if I wanted to have my cookies spread out less then I would use 60-65 degree butter and use room temperature eggs? Also, I know people chill their cookie batter before baking not just for flavor development but so that the cookies doesn’t spread as much. Wouldn’t it be more efficient to apply and rely on these techniques than it is to chill the batter? If anything once the walls that is from the butter is too warm they become weak and chilling the cookie batter doesn’t really do anything to trap any more air and therefore wouldn’t make your cookies spread less/rise more. Another weird thing I heard about creaming was from a book called “The Elements of Dessert”, which said that using a finer grain of sugar like superfine or powdered aides in the creaming process because it dissolves better and faster in the fat versus granulated. Is this because when you cream the sugar into the butter or cream the butter and sugar (I’m not sure the correct way to say it) the process of combining them HAS to come first and then as you beat faster you are then able to mechanically mix in AND trap the air?",BlackHorseMamba,askculinary,Can someone help me fill in the gap about what I dont know about creaming fat and sugar As Ive been baking and researching about baking Ive come confused about what the sugar is actually doing when it gets creamed into the fat Im not sure if I even used the term cream correctly there I do understand that when you cream the sugar and fat you are creating air pockets which give the space that leaveners use to expand in Peoples advice on techniques for this that Ive come across is what is confusing me Americas Test Kitchens ATK research says that using chilled butter that is defined as  degrees F or when pressed with a finger leaves a crack is superior in leavening or creating those air pockets than butter at room temp which is about  degrees F or there is no crack in the butter when pressed with a finger They also showed what happens when you use melted butter What was shown was that as the butter loses its solid nature it becomes harder to create those air pockets In my mind I akin the butter to the substance that is the wall that surrounds the air and as that gets less solid it gets increasingly difficult to trap air or create air pockets What makes butter special is that it has these betaprime crystals that are just the right size versus the larger ones found in lard which is apparently too large to hold in the air They also point out that as you beat the butter the temperature of it will rise a few degrees If I wanted to be safe I would definitely be going for the low s in butter temp To concur with ATK I have Milk Bars cookbook and Tossi goes on about creaming the butter and sugar She goes the extra mile and does it longer than most people intuitively would I think it was  minutes which is basically the time ATK uses for their pound cake recipe However when ATK cream the butter and sugar for their lemon bundt cake its only for three minutes and they dont care much about temperature of the egg other than it should be room temperature Whilst in the pound cake you need to beat the eggs before hand and then gradually add them in and beat for an additional  minutes I only note these eggs instructions parts because they say since its more difficult to incorporate a colder egg into the creamed butter and sugar you can actually break the air pockets in that time versus using room temperature eggs If I were to believe what is going on here youd want to be more careful with more delicate cakes like pound cake that doesnt rely on chemical leaveners Heres where things get tricky for me If I were to apply these principles would it be fair to say that if I wanted to have my cookies spread out less then I would use  degree butter and use room temperature eggs Also I know people chill their cookie batter before baking not just for flavor development but so that the cookies doesnt spread as much Wouldnt it be more efficient to apply and rely on these techniques than it is to chill the batter If anything once the walls that is from the butter is too warm they become weak and chilling the cookie batter doesnt really do anything to trap any more air and therefore wouldnt make your cookies spread lessrise more Another weird thing I heard about creaming was from a book called The Elements of Dessert which said that using a finer grain of sugar like superfine or powdered aides in the creaming process because it dissolves better and faster in the fat versus granulated Is this because when you cream the sugar into the butter or cream the butter and sugar Im not sure the correct way to say it the process of combining them HAS to come first and then as you beat faster you are then able to mechanically mix in AND trap the air,0

401,c5aiu0,"Pommes purée too liquid, how to improve?","The pommes purée recipe that I learned is to mix boiled and mashed potatoes with half it's weight in butter, and half it's weight in cream heated on the stove with garlic, shallots and bouquet garni and then whisk together until incorporated. That is absolutely delicious, but it's like soup, it has to be poured rather than scooped onto plate. For better texture I slightly undercook the potatoes so that they're firmer, and I use a wider sieve rather than a chinois, but it's still very liquid. When I have company what I do is put the pommes purée in a casserole and broil it for 10 minutes, so the top and sides get browned enough to hold everything else in and allow it to be sliced and served like a pie, or like how polenta is traditionally served.

But I'd really rather them be less liquid. I have some ideas, first is to make a bechamel rather than just using cream because the flour might thicken up the potatoes, the second is to add an egg or perhaps an egg white and what my mother suggested is to bake rather than boil the potatoes the night before, so that they're drier when I prepare them. I use Yukon Gold or King Edward potatoes, Russets and other white potatoes have a mealy feeling that I don't like.

402,c4q9xl,Help me make better fusion dumplings,"I've made dumplings following [this recipe from Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/the-best-japanese-pork-and-cabbage-dumplings-gyoza-recipe.html) several times. They turn out pretty well flavor wise, but I am unsatisfied with how the filling seems to turn into a bit of a puck inside the wrapper during cooking. When eating the dumpling in two bites, there's a decent chance the other half of the filling might fall out of the dumpling between bites.

&amp;#x200B;

I made them last year for a large family gathering (a very long afternoon of wrapping beforehand). They liked them a lot, and have requested I make them again. Obviously I could make the same thing and it would be a people pleaser, but I'm unsatisfied with making EXACTLY the same thing because it didn't meet my expectations. I have done a few test batches with different types of filling to see if I can get a better texture and different flavors, and I hope that you all can help me refine these to make something I really enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

My real goal is to make tasty smoked pork dumplings with an Asian flavor, thus the 'fusion' in my title. On try number one, I smoked a pork butt with a traditional BBQ rub containing sugar. The pork was good, very smoky with a sweet and savory bark. I mixed it with typical Asian flavors (garlic, ginger, scallion) plus a little Memphis BBQ sauce and gochujang as something to bind the meat and veggies. It was ok, but very strong on the BBQ sauce. The gochujang provided a nice spicy kick behind the sweet BBQ sauce but in general I felt that it was too sweet. Texture was more like what I wanted - because the meat was already cooked it did not clump as it cooked. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second attempt was yesterday, and I tried to build on what I learned above. Here's what I used in the filling:

* Smoked pork that had been rubbed in salt and gochujang pre-smoke, chopped to 1/4"" peices
* Shredded napa cabbage, about 1/2 the weight of the pork.
* Garlic
* Scallions
* Ginger
* The accumulated juices from the pork from cooking/resting. Thanks Chef John! I wanted to make sure some of the fat that had rendered off got back in since I removed most of the solid pork fat pre-shred.

Served with a dipping sauce of rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

I really liked it - it no longer had the loud sweet note from the BBQ sauce and the filling texture was loose, but not *too* loose. The vinegar dip really completes it for me, cutting through the heavier pork flavor. I would have appreciated a little more ""Asian"" flavor here, which is surprising because I was almost sure I overdid the garlic/ginger/scallions. The smoke was also really prominent. I actually liked that but my wife did not - she said it tasted like a smoked pork dumpling. To me, that's her agreeing that it needs more zing. Here's a couple ideas I had on what to try next, I'd love any comments on those or suggestions on how to to get better.

* Less smoke during the pork's cooking time - I smoked with apple chunks over charcoal and kept the smoke going for the first three hours of the 8 hour cook. I could just go with one hour to cut the smokiness in the final product and let the other flavors shine through.
* Use more cabbage - in the serious eats recipe, Kenji uses equal weights cabbage and meat. More cabbage filler means less meat per dumpling means less prominent smokiness and more other flavor, right?
* Cook the garlic/ginger before adding - maybe a really fast saute in sesame oil to bring out a little more flavor? The infused oil may also help.
* Add some liquid to the filling, like straight gochujang, rice wine vinegar, or Korean BBQ sauce?

Hey all-

I am a former pastry chef that now works as a high school culinary arts teacher. I teach advanced classes where we learn about all the knife cuts, stocks, sauces yada yada- but I also teach the beginners cooking classes and I’m really interested in making them better.

I have to use the state’s curriculum which, to me, seems very outdated. Think: What you used to make in home ec only slightly better. I guess this is a two point question. 1- what do you think should be covered in a 3 month beginners cooking class? This is assuming they don’t even know how to use a microwave. 2- I listed the stuff we are required to teach at this point below and I’m wondering if anyone has any thoughts/ideas on how to make these things more interesting. The state wants an emphasis on healthy eating so that is why we spend so much time learning about nutrients. I also would love input if you think I should rearrange the units or... you know, just anything is great actually! I really want my students to get excited about cooking and at this rate they are typically disappointed. I try my best to use unique and fun recipes but it still feels bland.

Units: 
Safety and Sanitation,
Equipment and Tools (a lot on microwaves),
Measurements, equivalents and converting recipes,
Cooking terms, 
Carbohydrates,
Proteins and Lipids,
Vitamins, Minerals and Water,
Dietary Guidelines

The first day I tell the students that it is more of a nutrition class than a cooking class, but even I find it boring to teach. I wish I could flip things to be more cooking-focused and the nutrients would be something we learn alongside that. We do cook a decent amount, but it’s all about the nutrient we are currently studying.

I didn't season the beef then chill it overnight, which a lot of recipes recommend - would this help the salt get in better?

Also, would leaving the ribs in the oven for more time, e.g. 3 hrs, make it more tender or will it just dry out?

442,c4gyc5,Questions on making homemade vanilla extract!,"So, I've searched around the sub for a bit and wasn't able to find the answers to some of my questions, so thought I'd make a new post asking for what other people have done.

Firstly, what does ""fold"" mean? I know it refers to strength of the extract, but how do I create a two/double fold vanilla extract versus a single? Is it just how many beans I put into the extract? Or does it refer to making the extract, then removing the beans and adding *more* and letting it steep again? 

What kind of jars have other people used and liked? This is more of a preference question. There are so many jars out there, it's kinda hard to pick one. I read that dark toned glass jars are ideal, to avoid sunlight penetration.

Where should I store the jar while I steep it? Is it a kind of under-the-kitchen-sink sort of thing, or just in a cabinet, away of light situation? My kitchen doesn't get any AC in the summer, so it gets suuuper hot, especially when I'm baking. I'm thinking it might do better in my bedroom honestly for that reason, but I'm not sure if it really matters if it gets a bit warm.

Also, does it really matter how many beans I use, or how long I steep it for? Everyone seems to have a different number of beans or amount of liquor or proof level to use and how many months...

448,c46smq,Changing temp mid sous vide?,"Hello!

Apologies if this has been asked before. Did a search on reddit and google and haven't found much. Posting here and on r/SousVide. 

I'm looking for answers - both anecdotal and scientific - for the effect of a mid cook temp change.

I've been trying to figure out the right brisket timing x temperature for me. I've tried a few variations of 135f to to 155f for between 48h to 72h and finished both in the oven low and seared on high heat. I've tried both point and flat, and both still joined. I've tried both from the fridge and from frozen. It's hit and miss (and maybe the variation is due to a variable I'm not considering, such as the meat quality.)

Anyway, I wanna focus on the temp. I've had really good results from both the lowered and higher ends.

What happens if I start low for half the cook, then increase to the high range toward the end? Or vice versa?

Anyone tried it? Or understand the science well enough to hypothesise?

Edit: my understanding is that the higher temp achieves a different texture (ie it's not just about speeding up the cook) . The lower temp (theoretically) retains more moisture and is more steak like (firmer, sliceable) vs higher is dryer but more fall apart tender (and therefore demands a shorter cook to retain moisture).

459,c40bjk,Homemade chocolate extract and soaked cacao nibs,"Hiya folks, ive got 3 questions im hoping someone can advise on regarding homemade  chocolate extract. 

1. How long to let the cacao nibs soak? Ive made several extracts -- vanilla, orange, coconut and chocolate. The vanilla seems fine so far. The coconut was not developing flavour so I nixed it. The peels used in the orange extract,  however, got a little weird and the extract developed a slightly odd smell (and maybe flavour) after about 2 months or so. I was pretty surprised but I guess they were decomposing in the vodka? Now I know cacao nibs are not the same consistency as orange rind, but can they also go bad inside the alcohol? Is there a recommended time at which its best to remove them? (Fwiw, I drained the orange extract and kept the liquid but part of me wonders if I ought to pour it out. I wish I knew how long to keep them in for.)

2. What can I do with them post-removal? I might not be able to use them right away so is freezing an option?

3. This might be unexpected but how is chocolate extract actually used? I only made it because I had found a bag of nibs on sale and wanted to try them.

***Frosting***

* 1½ cups (10 1/2 ounces) sugar
* ¼  cup (1 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 3  tablespoons cornstarch
* ½  teaspoon salt
* 1½ cups milk
* 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
* 2  teaspoons vanilla extract
*

***Cake***

* 1¾ cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup (3/4 ounce) unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2  tablespoons ground ginger
* 1½ teaspoons baking powder
* 1  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¾  teaspoon salt
* ½  teaspoon ground white pepper
* ⅛  teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1  cup brewed coffee
* ¾  cup molasses
* ½  teaspoon baking soda
* 1½ cups (10 1/2 ounces) sugar
* ¾  cup vegetable oil
* 3  large eggs, beaten
* 2  tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
* ¼  cup chopped crystallized ginger (optional) 

**To Prepare**

1. For the frosting: Whisk sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt together in medium saucepan. Slowly whisk in milk until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly and scraping corners of saucepan, until mixture is boiling and is very thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer milk mixture to wide bowl and let cool completely, about 2 hours.

1. For the cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line pans with parchment paper. Whisk flour, cocoa, ground ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and cayenne together in large bowl. Whisk coffee, molasses, and baking soda in second large bowl until combined. Add sugar, oil, eggs, and fresh ginger to coffee mixture and whisk until smooth.

1. Whisk coffee mixture into flour mixture until smooth. Pour 1 1/3 cups batter into each prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cakes cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto wire rack and peel off parchment; reinvert cakes. Wipe pans clean with paper towels. Grease and flour pans and line with fresh parchment. Repeat baking and cooling process with remaining batter.
1. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add cooled milk mixture and vanilla; mix on medium speed until combined, scraping down bowl if necessary. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.

1. Place 1 cake layer on platter or cardboard round. Using offset spatula, spread ¾ cup frosting evenly over top, right to edge of cake. Repeat stacking and frosting with 2 more cake layers and 11/2 cups frosting. Place final cake layer on top and spread remaining frosting evenly over top and sides of cake. Garnish top of cake with crystallized ginger, if using. Refrigerate cake until frosting is set, about 30 minutes. (Cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days.

So he just covers his steak in oil, and while the steak is cooking, he adds his seasonings (rosemary, lemon, grated garlic) onto his cutting board and tops it with slivers of butter. When the steak has browned, he places the steak over the butter, then cuts it into slices and tosses it in its own juices.

481,c3fgb0,"Yogurt bacteria, fermentation temperatures, etc.","I have been making yogurt a few times. I have an electric yogurt maker which works at around 45C.

My starter is a freeze-dried blend of Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). Apparently they work synergistically.

Despite the names, L. bulgaricus is actually slightly more thermophilic than S. thermophilus. S. thermophilus seems to be most active at 41-43C. Lower or higher temperatures result in lower lactic acid production L. bulgaricus seems to be ok in a wide range, but maybe around 40C-50C.

Anyway, I am looking at a supplier of starter cultures, they offer:

* S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus 'Balkan'
* S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus 'Bulgarian' (it is not clear if there is a significant difference in the blend)
* S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus
* L. acidophilus 
* S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus , Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum biotypes
* S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, B. longum biotypes, B. adolescentis, B. breve (in capsule form, rather than sachet

Apparently the term 'probiotic' refers to any live bacteria consumed, as distinct from a 'prebiotic', which stimulates the growth of existing bacteria within the gut.

In addition, if you are making or consuming yogurt, there is no particular guarantee that the bacteria are live - the bacteria ferment producing lactic acid, but they may in fact be dead at the point of consumption. The fermentation process obviously does produce various compounds resulting in the flavour profile of the yogurt, but I guess the bacteria themselves don't taste of anything.

It seems that neither S. thermophilus nor L. bulgaricus are considered probiotic - while they are live bacteria, they are not there for any putative benefit to the gut , but simply to ferment the milk into yogurt.

OTOH, L. acidophilus IS considered a probiotic bacteria, and also can ferment milk, alone, though it does not thicken as much as traditional strains. From what I can gather, the characteristic of L. acidophilus is a slower ferment, and more acetic acid relative to lactic acid when compared to L. bulgaricus. S. thermophilus does not seem to be a significant source of acetic acid. Note that if you use a S. thermophilus &amp; L. acidophilus blend, or indeed S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus, and ferment at high temperatures, it seems that the L. acidophilus won't be doing much of the work. Also if you want a pure L. acidophilus ferment, then you should likely seek out an adjustable yogurt maker, as I've tried a couple of non-adjustable yogurt makers, and they are around the 44/45C range, at which temperature the L. acidophilus is not growing, and barely working. At 37C it will be working, possibly as high as 40C, but a standard commercial yogurt maker will be hopeless. It is slightly surprising that vendors are selling such bacteria without any warning that they won't work in common yogurt makers.

The bifidobacteria, otoh, produce 3 parts acetic acid to 2 parts lactic acid, so a pure bifido ferment would result in a 'vinegar' yogurt. 

Presumably for this reason probiotics may be added AFTER fermentation, when temperatures have been cooled (although fermentation will continue at fridge temperature, such that after a month a yogurt containing L. acidophilus (and L. bulgaricus?) is noticeably 'vinegary'), so you are essentially doing little more than consuming a capsule when you eat the yogurt. 

The notion of happy bacteria producing some tasty food that you then consume and it makes you healthier seems to be a little distant from the truth, as it looks like to whatever extent the Bifidobacteria are there (and possibly to a lesser extent L. acidophilus) they are not necessarily doing the job of making a tasty food, and you could just gulp a pill with the same contents - however 'healthy, natural, fermented' yogurt is obviously more appealing to the average person than taking pills.

At any rate I should add that I haven't tried the Bifido bacteria - obviously to the extent that they are added and are working then a 'vinegar' flavour is part of an overall profile that may be pleasing to  me but not to you.

I found a bacteria table, which says:

* L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (this is NOT the same as L. lactis) - range 18-50C, optimum 40C
* L. bulgaricus 22-52, optimum 45C
* L. helveticus (probiotic, used in cheese, possible use in yogurt?)  - 22-54C, optimum 42C. The three above have a similar lactic acid concentration - 1.5 - 1.8%
* L. acidophilus 27-48C optimum 37C, 0.3-1.9% lactic acid. As with the other three, this is listed as homofermentative, i.e. lactic acid as the primary by-product, rather than multiple main by-products. However, the pH and acid concentration is higher, suggesting a milder yogurt
* L. kefir (Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens?) / L. brevis - 8-42C, optimum 30/32, heterofermentative, 1.2-1.5% lactic acid
* L. casei - again, probiotic, used in Cheddar, added to some commercial probiotic drinks. Appears to be similar to L. acidophilus in that it requires fermentation at 37C. A graph I found showed a pH of 4.5 at 12 hours, reaching a peak of pH 3.5 at 36 hours. However whereas commercial yogurts are from what I can see NEVER sold below 4.2 pH (ranging from 4.2-4.9 pH), taste testers preferred L. casei yogurt at 32 hours or beyond (i.e. when the pH reached its most acidic), or longer. It is also noted that beyond 24 hours L. bulgaricus start to die (it is my understanding that in commercial production you would blast chill your yogurt), but for both L. acidophilus and L. casei they continued to be viable, and peak amino acid production was at 44 hours, even while the pH did not drop further.
* Bifidobacterium - 22-48C, peak 37C, lactic acid 0.1-0.4%, pH 4.5

The greater risk at 37C is other bacteria outcompeting the desirable bacteria. You can make a product called 'acidophilus milk' by fermenting milk at 37C following heat treatment, producing a product with a similar lactic acid content to yogurt. I am not clear if this 'fermented acidophilus milk' would turn into yogurt if fermented longer. 

Some sources suggest that S. thermophilus &amp; L. acidophilus is used to create a milder yogurt, while S. thermophilus &amp; L. bulgaricus is a more characteristic yogurt taste.

488,c3b21s,Swordfish Taco Questions,"I plan on grilling swordfish to make swordfish tacos while my parents are in town this weekend. However, my wife and I are mostly vegan/vegetarian so grilling isn't something that we're used to doing. My plan is to grill swordfish and then have a simple cabbage slaw, homemade salsa verde, pico de gallo, and a chipotle sour cream. 

For the swordfish I planned on preparing it very simply by patting them dry with paper towel, salt/pepper them, brush them with a  small amount of olive oil, and let them sit for 30 minutes.

My questions are about cooking the swordfish. Most recipes simply say to get the grill to ~400 degF and cook for about 3 minutes per side. Should I just cook for 3 minutes per side or aim for a specific internal temperature? If I should aim for a specific temperature should it be the recommended 145 degF, or should I try for something like 135-140 and let the meat carryover to 145? The swordfish steaks I plan on buying are 1.5 to 2 inches thick. Should I cut them thinner so that there is more charred flesh to put in the tacos?

489,c3dhhr,"Looking for some ideas for sweet dishes involving preserved lemons, and questions about cooking and flavour","Hello people!

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently finished a batch of preserved lemons that have been developing nicely over the last 2 months. I tried them today by including them in a ricotta pasta sauce to give some extra lemon flavour, and I very much enjoy the strong citrus notes they give together with a little bit of that fermentation funk. I did find that they bring a little bit of sweetness to the dish as well, so I'd like to see what can be done with them in sweet dishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my problem: I do not wish to try and mess too much with the funky flavour that they have developed so far, and I am worried that heating them will result in a disappearance of those notes. I thought of things like jam and simple syrups infused with the lemons, but both require heating. A good example of something I think would work well is a lassi that uses preserved lemons, but I would like to try and bake them into perhaps scones or shortbreads. Perhaps a cream cheese topping with preserved lemons or a cheesecake infused with them could be a good idea?

510,c34470,Carbon steel - Matfer/deBuyer vs cheap carbon steel,"Hi cooking fam!

I've been holding off on upgrading kitchenware for many reasons for years and it's now time to upgrade. I am confident cook in the kitchen and have a gas stovetop. Highest BTU is about 12,500.

I am upgrading to a lodge cast iron and all-clad already, but gear acquistion syndrome is kicking in and carbon steel is in the picture.

A carbon steel wok is being considered and the only thing holding me back is the feasibility of having one. I will be borrowing a friends wok and wok ring to experiment soon. Carbon steel pans seem to appeal to me most and in the long run, I think this is what I'll prefer but in meantime, I'd to practise a Lodge cast iron and all-clad is versatile enough for myself and my mum. 

Having said that, there are inexpensive carbon steel pans.

I don't think they are as heavy/thick as a Matfer or deBuyer.

What do you guys think of paying $20 for an experiment carbon steel? Is it even worth the effort?

A confident cook upgrading kitchenware after 10 years of delays and choosing between:

1) Lodge Cast Iron + All-clad fry-pan + carbon steel wok + **NO CARBON STEEL PAN**

519,c2x1er,"Tips for getting pizza on peel, and for launching? Reducing flour on bottom of pizza? Using fresh mozzarella?","I've been on a quest to master pizza for a few months now. It's always getting better, but I'm still struggling with a few things.

Any tips on any of them would be awesome. I'm making the pizza in my oven with a baking steel and the broiler.

1. Getting pizza on the peel. I see people in videos just pick up the end, and drag the whole thing onto the peel. That rarely seems to go well for me. It tears or gets misshapen or screws up in some other way. At best, it becomes elongated and no longer round, and it's REALLY hard for me to readjust its shape after the toppings are on, so I'm kind of stuck with whatever shape ends up on the peel. Should I be shaping on the peel? I feel like that's asking to create a sticky situation at launch time. My peel is about 1.5"" thick and wooden. Do I need a flat metal one instead? I saw Bon Appetit attempt to quickly shove metal peels under their pizza and it didn't often go well, so I'm not sure that's the solution. Is my dough just too wet?
2. Launching the pizza is hard. I shake it until it starts coming off the back of the peel. When it hits the steel, I start dragging the peel back. Sometimes it goes well, sometimes not. Sometimes the pizza is too far forward and my pizza is too big, so part of it hangs off the steel. It's just always frustrating.
3. The times it goes smoothly, it's mostly because I have plenty of flour on the peel. But sometimes/most times that leads to a floury bottom, which I really don't like the mouth feel of. It's not necessarily TERRIBLE, but it's just not ideal.
4. I can't seem to find full-fat low moisture mozzarella. I'm trying to make a style that leans toward New York, so I don't really want the pockets of mozzarella. Is there a proper way to ""dry"" my cheese to make it more like low-moisture? It's pretty hard to evenly spread full-moisture mozzarella. I've tried breaking it up onto paper towels but it's still pretty damp after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. Also, is there a guide somewhere that says what different adjustments to dough will do to your finished product? Like what changes about the end product when your dough is dryer/wetter? What changes when you knead it too much or too little? What gives it chew? What makes it crispier?

539,c2hgim,Please help troubleshoot my cupcakes,"I am trying to make funfetti cupcakes for my kid’s third birthday. So far, I have tried two very different recipes with very similar results.

Notes:
* I am a novice baker. I bake cookies and quick breads from scratch and they turn out 99% of the time. 
* My oven does not strictly have a middle rack. It has four positions. For baking, I use the third rack from the top so that the top of the pan isn’t too close to the top burner. 
* I am using Bob’s Red Mill whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose. I’ve never had any issues with this substitution for quick breads or pancakes. 
* My cupcake pan is of the dark non-stick variety. I am using paper liners. 
* I don’t think I’m overfilling - the batter is spilling out because the cakes are bubbling up. 
* I measure most ingredients using a food scale, with the exception of baking powder, baking soda and salt. 
* I bought new baking powder and baking soda between the two attempts. 

*Attempt 1*: [One-bowl vegan funfetti cupcakes](https://minimalistbaker.com/one-bowl-vegan-funfetti-cupcakes/)

We aren’t vegan but we have a little friend with an anaphylactic egg allergy so I tried this recipe using cow’s milk. The batter overflowed and bubbled up while baking so the tops were flat and rough. The cake itself was very moist but had a large crumb and little structural integrity. It was loose, basically. I mixed this one with an electric hand mixer but over-mixing usually results in a dense, tight crumb. 

*Attempt 2*: [Easy funfetti cupcakes](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-homemade-funfetti-cupcakes/)

The result was shockingly similar to the first. They looked about the same - bubbled over, spilling out of the cups, shiny, flat tops and too loose to call itself a cupcake. 

This recipe called for melted butter and hand-mixing. When I added the yogurt, egg and milk, the wet batter formed small chunks. Is that because my yogurt, egg and milk were cold and caused the butter to solidify into tiny bits?

The bottoms of the cupcakes were buttery and greasy while the tops tasted sugary and were crunchy where they touched the pan, as though there was a separation during the baking process. The bits that stuck to the pan after overflowing were crunchy but delicious and the cake left in the cups were less so.

I’m sure that the poor emulsification likely caused issues but the first recipe didn’t even have butter. So, I tried two very different recipes and methods but had very similar results and nothing I can serve. I’m also using mostly organic ingredients so these failures aren’t cheap.

558,c1ut8t,"A Pizza Delivery Place Has Dropped Into My Lap! Thinking Naturally Leavened Dough, am I crazy?!","Some background:  I have spent the past 6 years delivering and managing for a large Big Ten Football town operation and I've paid attention.  I have also spent some time working with start-up restaurants helping to build business plans, marketing plans, menus, etc.  I would consider myself a well above average home cook with a good degree of bread making experience (probably not nearly enough, but its a start).

Essentially a pizza place with a conveyor oven has dropped into a friends lap and we are going to launch a new place; it should be good.

So, I have dough questions!!!!

The most recent ""commercial"" recipe I've found is Anthony Falco's; I am planning to start there, but would fall over backwards for other suggestions ;)  [Falco's Recipe](https://www.pizzatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/doughchart.jpg)

1. I would like to do all my dough from leaven, probably buying some Italian and/or San Fran cultures from International Sourdoughs and going from there....  am I crazy?  Will these types of dough work in a conveyor?  If so, will it only work with specific pans?
2. Will the Deep Dishes/Stuffed work with the conveyor? Par-bake?
3. Thoughts, experiences, resource suggestions, roast me?

In closing I will leave you with a quote from Douglas Adams by way of Zaphod Beeblebrox:

“That really is truly amazing. It’s so amazingly amazing, I think I’d like to steal it.”

I make small batches of jam from seasonal fruit for my own consumption. I recently discovered that using a thermometer makes things pretty well fool proof - heat it up to 105 degrees and that is it, jar it and a guaranteed set each time!

Now, tonight I made a batch of jam, but I think I might have boiled it up too much before I used the thermometer as it started to go darker than it should have. I put the thermometer in, but instead of reading more than 105, it was reading less and did not move much as I continued, but went darker with sugar eventually caramalising on the base of the pot.

592,c1tmxj,Hibachi Style Fried Rice - beige colored sauce added during cooking,"I have done a lot of googling and searching on this subreddit before posting.

At my favorite local Hibachi style restaurant (Kansai in Louisville, KY), their fried rice is made pretty normally, but there's a beige colored sauce added in addition to the soy sauce.

They've referred to it as a mustard sauce, so it might be something like this, but I'm not sure if this is something that would make sense to mix into the fried rice during cooking.

https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/nonas-japanese-steakhouse-mustard-sauce-185716#activity-feed

They put down rice that has onion carrots and peas in it already. The cook the eggs and mix it in. They add butter then soy sauce and this other sauce.

It might be yum yum sauce, but I think the bottle they pour it out of is a different bottle than the one that they the yum yum sauce into the containers for each person from.

This recipe has a yum yum sauce component that might be it.

It simply was one of the first I found. 

In this recipe, as in many others I saw, the cook is asked to **proof yeast.**

I took the correct amount of milk and heated it. When it cooled off to 104 F (I used a thermometer), I poured the biological dry yeast. I don't know if I should've kept an eye on the temperature for the entire process. But I let it sit for 15 min and nothing happened. The milk simply looked the same.

I don't lose all the other ingredients by adding the yeast that didn't get activated properly. And at this point, I've failed this recipe twice.

Regardless, the end result was that I always got a nice, tasty brioche. 

However, this time, I don't understand why my dough takes so long to proof, nor why I am not smelling the lovely (almost alcoholic) smell of the yeast metabolising the sugar. Instead, it's the smell of yeast mixed with something like cardboard.  

Is it because I'm using French butter instead of Lurpak butter? But both have 82g of fat. 

Or perhaps I didn't leave my yeast to bloom enough? I'm using instant dry yeast, and bloomed in water of around 35 degree Celsius.

654,c0rfks,"Very long cutting boards - where to get one, how to maintain?","I've had a quick search and haven't found any posts that look like they're quite getting at this, so here it is - note that this is all in a home context;

I like to prep ingredients beforehand, but using a million tiny bowls at home is ludicrous - so I generally will prep into small piles onto my cutting board and then place the entire board in the fridge (maybe an extra container depending on the recipe or for raw meats etc). This means one or two things to clean afterward rather than like twenty.

From a desire to do this as efficiently as possible a number of reasonably unrealistic requirements for a new cutting board have emerged;

1. The board should be pretty shallow, yet exceptionally long so as to fit onto the shelving in the fridge. This also allows for more prep space. I'm talking as shallow as 30 cm (\~12 in) while as being as long as 66 cm (\~26 in). Probably fairly thick to make it last a while. At the same time, I'll need to be able to lift the fucker. Finding this kind of specific size seems really tough, so I'm feeling like I might have to either custom-order, custom-make or cut down an existing board.
2. The board needs to be okay with staying cold and possibly a bit damp for extended periods. I have a feeling this discourages woods in particular given that material may be soaking in for many hours. For this use case I'm considering some kind of synthetic rubber (e.g. Hi-Soft, Sanituff, etc) that won't be porous and can be buffed down to restore a smooth surface if need be. I feel like plastic would be okay, but I also don't want to replace the whole thing when its surface gets cut up given all of the effort (presumably) taken to obtain this absurdly dimensioned board.
3. Maintenance. Washing, drying, and oiling up a wooden board of this size sounds pretty rough. I'd be looking for something that I slap down on the bench, wipe down with hot soap and maybe sanitizer and then wipe dry and call it a day. Again, synthetic seems like the go.

Though obviously I'm replacing sunny side up eggs with sliced hard-boiled in the latter...the yolk keeps falling out, both when I try to cut it and when I try to plate it. I'd prefer to keep each slice a solid piece instead of having both the white and yolk break apart and scatter throughout the dish. Any suggestions for both cutting and keeping the yolk 'stuck' to the white after cutting would be great!

660,c0ugdk,Indian food lovers—what did I make?,"Hey all,

I just made something pretty tasty by improvising, was wondering if it’s close to a traditional dish. Or if y’all have any suggestions to improve. 

Was going for a Indian beef coconut curry braise—I started by browning 2.5 lbs of beef stew meat in a dutch oven, then removed and added 2 finely diced large onions and eventually slices of fresh ginger, a bulb of garlic (w/o root to make it easier to remove skin later), turmeric, cumin, coriander, cloves, a cinnamon stick, and red pepper flakes. Then added back the meat, added water and a bit of fish sauce, brought to a boil, and put into a 350 degree oven for \~3 hours.

I was originally going for a coconut curry, but I read that coconut milk curdles if you cook it for a long time, so was planning on adding some at the end. 

But when I took it out, seemed like it needed something tangy to balance out the onions and spices, so added a some greek yogurt instead.

And it tastes pretty good! Meat dried out a bit because I didn’t bother to check on the liquid levels in the oven, but still pretty excellent. Just not what I was originally intending.

Anyway, does this map onto any sort of traditional Indian dish?

(Edit note: that picture came from the recipe website. It is not my pie.)

I'm not a beginner to pie-making. I have delicious and successful recipes for blueberry, apple, pecan, and peach. 

I've never before made a blackberry pie, and none of my recipes use cornstarch for a thickener, so I don't know where to start with the troubleshooting.

I used wild-picked berries, from my yard. They're pretty tart, so I used the full amount of sugar. I didn't know how balanced my berries were for ripeness, so I used the middle of the range of cornstarch. I wove a lattice top, so it should have been adequately vented. I was uneasy with the foil over the entire top of the pie, but I did it anyways because it was a new recipe. 

The only thing I changed is the size: I have a TON of berries, so I used a 10-inch deep dish plate, and made the recipe 1.5 times to fill the plate.

It came out delicious. But it only set for about 2 inches around the perimeter of my pie plate; the center was completely liquid. Additionally, in case it's relevant, the berries in the cooled pie were still intact/solid. I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen with blackberry pie?

684,c0cmz0,Salvaging a Recipe: Shrimp Po Boys - Only have pre-cooked shrimp,"Hi all -

So, tonight is ""Speedycat Surprise!"" night at our house. That is where I, the lesser cook in the house, fix dinner. And Surprise! Sometimes it ends up being carry-out because something goes wrong. I'm really hoping to avoid that tonight.

I bought the ingredients to make the [Serious Eats Shrimp Po Boys recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/02/shrimp-po-boys.html). I came home, made the remoulade and started to get to work on the shrimp. First step: Thaw the suckers.

That's when I realized I have frozen pre-cooked shrimp, not frozen, raw shrimp. :(

How should I try to salvage this? I'm thawing the shrimp now. They're big suckers. I was thinking I'd pat them dry and take one of two approaches:

* Coat them with a little cornstarch and creole seasoning, then pan-fry them in a small amount of vegetable oil, just to heat them through and crisp them up
* Don't coat them with any cornstarch or flour and just sautee them, instead of any attempt to crisp them up

I suppose I could also just keep them cold, but... yuck? But maybe like a shrimp salad? The thing is I have the remoulade sauce already made. I'm thinking that getting a good cook/toast on the hoagie rolls will be especially important now that I haven't got anything I can actually deep fry.

That  makes it harder to cook additional rice pasta. It's a pretty niche recipe, but it sounds similar to chicken and dumplings soup. Having a better recipe would help too. Any suggestions on the seafood stock?

I'm  getting my first soapstone pot soon, and there's a lot less e-knowledge  around about seasoning soapstone vs. other seasoning processes like  cast iron.

Anglophone  sources seem to suggest coating in oil once or twice, while the Indian  DIY videos I've found show many coatings of castor oil (which I  definitely won't be using), tumeric and rice starch over a period of  days. Two example sources are provided, below.

Has anyone seasoned soapstone cookware, before? If so, what were the results?

Thanks!

760,byxi9q,Looking to improve on a home recipe for chicken and mushroom gravy that was handed down through family.,"edit:  you guys are awesome.  Thank you for all of your ongoing tips!  I will be trying a way to make my own gravy, soon.  My wife and I area about to start a keto run for the next 4 months so, anything we can do to curb the carbs and keep flavor in our menu is on the table!  Thanks for your help!

The following recipe was handed down to me through family.  It has been a staple several times a year as long as I can remember.  My mom served this with a salad with a home made vinegar and oil dressing and a dark brown bread.   My issue is that my chicken is tasting a bit watery.  What I love about this is the taste the vermouth gives to the mushroom soup and how it thins it out, but not too much to make it soupy.  

Any thoughts on what I can do to make this more savory?


Grab a pack of 5 or 6 chicken breasts.

2 large and 1 small can of cream of mushroom soup

1 large sweet onion

1 750ml of extra dry vermouth 

salt and pepper

1 clove garlic

Get a large and deep sauce pan


dice onion and saute with olive oil

you can slice up the chicken or add the breasts whole.  Add salt and pepper to raw chicken.  Brown the chicken.    turn maybe twice.   still raw? No problem, this is gonna cook another 40m.

Next, add all 3 cans of cream of mushroom and the garlic.   Reduce heat and cook for 10m.

791,byntib,Bearnaise sauce with dried tarragon? Or substituting for a different herb?,"I've never made bearnaise before, but with school being out (first year teacher whoohoo!) I have newfound free time and want to treat myself. Unfortunately, I kinda live in the hood and I couldn't find fresh tarragon anywhere around me. Dried, yes but no fresh tarragon to be found.

I do have some meaty 16 ounce ribeyes and all the other ingredients in Chef John's recipe (I'd link but am on mobile presently). I also did a very brief search and found that adding other herbs could work. So I have some dried tarragon along with a good amount of fresh rosemary.

So my question, I guess, is twofold:

1) If using a different herb such as rosemary, is it advisable to substitute for the fresh tarragon in a one to one ratio? Or should I use a bit more or less? My inclination says fresh rosemary can be overpowering and I should use less (this is my first time eating bearnaise let alone eating it).

2) If I use the dried tarragon, should I use the standard 3-to-1 fresh-to-dried ratio for most herbs, and will that give me equally tasty results?

Plus all the usual suspects: Star Anise, lemongrass, Ginger, etc... 

The plan is to have a bunch of proteins, vegetables (pickled and otherwise), and condiments plated up for people to make their own bowl with the simmering stock. Plan to have enough for everyone to have two bowls because of timing and people will be hungry. Sprouts, shitload of herbs, peppers onions carrots (pickled and fresh), crispy onions, and peanuts. Reverse seared top round roast sliced thinly, marinated and grilled pork tenderloin thinly sliced, grilled shrimp, and some sort of chicken. 

1. Going to season all of them, but with the chicken should I use b/s breasts and slice thinly or b/s thighs and cube?

I normally use fish sauce in the stock, however I picked up 4oz dried shrimp and 6oz dried anchovies from a market today. Will this end up too fishy or too salty? I’ve never used dried seafood products before. I’m not married to the fish sauce and have omitted it before, but I miss it when it’s not there. What I usually make is good, but I’d like to incorporate the dried products - honestly just because that seems to be the consensus for the best base. 

Skip the shrimp shells and save for something else? Pick dried shrimp or dried anchovies, not both? Maybe just use a couple shakes of fish sauce in the finished stock to taste? Sorry for the novel.

Then I make the custard using that cream, sometimes increasing the milk proportion or decreasing the egg proportion based on how much the cream reduces.

829,by3nr1,"I love masala omlettes in the morning, is there any way I can do the prep work and freeze beforehand while still making a passable omlette?","I usually end up cooking low effort food for breakfast because I don't have much time before work and generally don't want to have to deal with a whole mess in the kitchen. I LOVE masala omlettes, but the prep work of chopping the onions, tomatoes and cilantro is just way too much in the AM and I usually end up making scrambled eggs or a plain omlette instead.

My recipie for a masala omlette is basically just to heat some ghee in a pan, beat 3 eggs with some turmeric, salt, chilli powder and chopped onions, tomatoes and cilantro and then cook until set. 

I was thinking about chopping up and making a ""mix"" of the three vegetable ingredients above (onions, tomatoes and cilantro) and maybe freezing it or something so it's ready for me to cook up when I want it. I would rather freeze than simply meal prep for the week in the fridge because I'm erratic about eating breakfast and I don't want to end up with a bunch of wasted food. 

My main concerns are:

1. Can I freeze these three ingredients together, or should I freeze them separately?

2. I thought about maybe freezing individual single omlette sized portions in large ice cube trays and then having a ""cube"" ready to go. Thoughts?

3. I feel like I would need to defrost the vegetables in order to make sure they cook along with the eggs. What would be the best way to do this to preserve taste and texture? In the microwave beforehand or just cooking it them before I add the eggs?

My mains question is if I leave it too long can the taste become too “fermented”? Or do I just leave it until the dough doubles in size? How does the cooking science change when using this type of dough?

(The flour in question is made of Potato starch, Tapioca starch, rice flour and Xathan Gum as the thickener?)

Edit: Editing just in case someone has the same problem as me, comes across this post and wants to know what I did. I didn’t leave it overnight. Instead I left it to rise for about 2-2.5 hours, then added a bit more oil to make it more moist and “kneaded” the dough with a plastic spatula to get the air out. Then I left it to “settle” it for about 30-40 mins. From there I just adde a bit of flour (the Doves Farm White Bread flour) so it would stick to my hand, spread it on parchment paper and make a rectangle, added my own homemade pizza sauce and cheese.

878,bx9tec,Weird Residue on Pan Underside After Searing Chicken,"Hi r/AskCulinary.  I hope this is the right place to be asking this question.  If not, maybe somebody could point me towards the right place to turn?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a budding home cook and the other day I tried baking chicken breasts.  It turned out really well!  However, the small frying pan in which I seared the meat before baking is almost completely unusable now.  After I had washed and dried it, my wife pointed out that large parts of the underside of the pan are very sticky and resistant when one strokes the underside with their finger.  I tried giving it a good scrub but that did not seem to help.  I was thinking maybe if I describe exactly how I made the chicken, one of you might recognize what caused the problem and how I can fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

I heated up olive oil in the pan on the stove top, and then placed two chicken breasts (one at a time) in the pan and browned each side.  I had the heat way too high because with the first breast it was almost like the oil was exploding off the pan.  It splattered hot oil everywhere around the stove (I suspect this is how residue got on the underside).  I turned the heat down for the second breast and there was no splatter.

&amp;#x200B;

In case this might be the culprit, I used Pam's olive oil spray to coat the wire rack in the baking pan I used to bake the chicken after searing.  I had the pan on the stove while I was using the spray.  It may have possibly gotten on the sides of the frying pan, if maybe that is what left the residue.

&amp;#x200B;

The texture of the residue is almost like when you peel off a sticker from a new purchase and there's a residue left over on the surface.  It doesn't smell, and it is clear.  Light reflects off of it differently than it does the rest of the pan.  The frying pan is a Calphalon 8"" pan.  I don't think it is stainless steel or cast iron, but it is kind of your standard quality black frying pan.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys know anything that might help?  Thank you. :)

889,bx0xk2,Keto mousse recipe idea,"Hey all so I’m trying to create a chocolate mousse with less than 2 net grams of carbs for a 80-90grams portion.

Here’s what I’m thinking

- 30g butter
- 10grams 90% dark chocolate 
- 30g cocoa powder unsweetened (around 20% net carbs)

Pour boiling butter on cocoa and chocolate, let sit, mix, cool

- 90grams egg white
- 20grams erythrol 

Whip together to firm peaks.

Fold in chocolate ganache.

3 portions come at 3 carbs each, but small portions.

Im wondering if

1) is there enough chocolate flavour?
2) total quantity is a bit low, could I add some coconut milk beverage or regular coconut milk to the chocolate ganache to increase volume?
3) would it make sense to add flax/chia for gelification?

890,bwzdyv,Issue with kimchi,"Hi,

I've made kimchi a few times before but have tried adding sugar for the first time. I'm on day 3 of the ferment and there's a layer of silt that's turned up on top of the kimchi. Is this a very bad sign? Do I need to chuck it and start over? Or is this nothing major and it'll be fine still?

Edit for clarity:
Recipe was to salt Napa cabbage and rub in salt until leaves start to wilt. Submerge in brine for 2 hours then drain and rinse through twice, squeeze to dry. Put in a fermentation vessel. Add sliced spring onion &amp; radish, fish sauce, a touch of soy sauce, a teaspoon of white sugar, a couple tablespoons of red chili and mix thoroughly. Place on top a sealed bag of fresh water to ensure kimchi stays submerged. Push down on kimchi twice a day to release gases.

* Turn off heat, let infuse for another 10.
* Add chopped prunes. Let them soak in the cream. Let cool. 
* Add walnuts and blend. Add crushed garlic, salt. Blend again.

What you guys think? Viable? Are szechuan\pink peppers fine in this kind of sauce?

* Chilies. Depending on what you have - use accordingly. I used 2 aribibi gusanos (470 000 SHU). 
* 3 cup chopped prunes
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp salt
* 6 cloves of garlic

1. Toast  pink peppercorns,  lightly crushed walnuts (be sure to get rid of any hard bits of the shell) and  szechuan peppercorns 
2. Put  light cream in a pot. Toasted peppercorns+walnuts in. Chillies in. I used Aribibi Gusano, but you can take what you have. Bring to just shy of boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
3. Gas off. Put in chopped prunes. Wait for the prunes to absorb the cream. 
4. Add olive oil, mustard, salt.
5. Blitz in a food processor. Back to the pot and simmer again. Add cream if you want it to be less thick.
6. Crush garlic and add to the puree mix. Blitz again. Taste for salt. add if needed.

The [final thing](https://pp.userapi.com/c850032/v850032755/1a2322/2n516DgDGXM.jpg) tastes wonderfull. The walnuts and the prunes give it nice thinckness and sweetness balanced by tingy garlic, heat from chilies and saltiness.

As I fry my wedges for the second time, I can feel the crispiness with my sieve as I move it around the oil and fries which is promising.

I take out the fries when I feel that they're really crispy (and they are crispy to the touch).

I give my fries a quick and gentle wipe to get rid of any visibly excess oil (at this point, the fries still feel crispy).

For example, here is one of the recipes: https://imgur.com/a/QbUwelc

If you were to follow this recipe verbatim you'd get something that looks like 80% bell peppers and 20% chicken. Nowhere close to the proportion pictured and not something that seems appropriate.

For just about every recipe in this book that has peppers, I have to halve the amount specified and it still seems a little excessive. So one thought is that perhaps Fu Pei-Mei used peppers of a different or much smaller variety?

Another possibility is translation error and I should be seeking out a different pepper altogether. I'm not fluent in any form of Chinese but there are enough obvious lost-in-translation moments in the book that I don't trust the English directions wholly.

927,bw3cx1,Is there a better word for “Christmassy” spices?,"**Edit** I didn’t quite make myself clear, I wasn’t looking for a synonym to “Christmas spice” as in “holiday, winter, festive”, etc. because that excludes a lot of the uses of these spices beyond western holidays and baked goods.

But, these spices are clearly similar in terms of flavor profiles, and I thought there might be a catch-all term for these particular kinds of spices, sort of like herbs, paparikas, etc. It seems the best phrase for what I was looking for is “warm spices”. 

—-original post:

Is there a categorical name for these spices: cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, etc. While most of them originate in Asian/eastern cuisines, and are not necessarily “sweet” dish spices, in western cuisine we associate them with desserts and to some extent, holiday baking. 

The real reason I’m asking is I’m developing a vegetable pickling spice mix that leans quite heavily on some of these spices, and I’d rather not call them “Christmas pickles” or “Pumpkin Spice pickles”.

All 3 have come out with gooey, nearly batter-like, consistency in their centers or ""deposits"" for lack of a better word. The weirdest part is that I've tested their centers with toothpicks and they come out **completely clean**. At first I thought I was not using something sticky enough to test for doneness so I tried skewers and steel chopsticks, still clean. 

Eventually distrusting the toothpick method I just bake them longer, to the point where the outer parts of the cakes are beginning to dry out. Still the centers are completely underdone. 

I've tried to rotate them during baking, moving them to different racks, moving the racks to different heights and nothing works. I'm at a loss and tired of baking something that only half of can be eaten.

I'm making a veal stew (a variation on blanquette de veau) , I've made it many times before and normally I slow cook for 6-7 hours. This time though, it's only been cooking for less than 4 hours and it's looking pretty tender already. I don't want to serve for another 3 hours.

I've put the pan on a smaller hob ring with the lowest possible heat, but I'm still worried it's going to be mush by the time I serve it. Can I take it off the heat altogether, and just put it back on shortly before serving? Or is there anything else I can do here?

It's my husband's birthday and his favourite dish, and the last time I made it I accidentally served the leftovers to our dog (who stuck her nose in it then walked away, to add insult to injury) - so I'm really hoping this isn't an inevitable disaster!!

954,bvhl0k,"Why didn't Sorghum become as widely consumed as wheat, maize or rice?","# Background

I recently came back from an 8 week business trip to South America. I already learnt from previous experience in my garden that [Sorghum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum_bicolor) is extremely easy to grow, even in infertile soils, so I sowed some to grow while I was away. The plan worked perfectly:

[https://i.redd.it/ll13rn85en131.png](https://i.redd.it/ll13rn85en131.png) 

# 2 other reasons why I grow Sorghum:

1. Sorghum leaves contain [Cyanogenic glycosides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside#Cyanogenic_glycosides), which can be hydrolysed to form cyanide. The reason I want to do this is because I want to expand on [u/CodyDon](https://new.reddit.com/u/CodyDon/)'s [Dissolving Gold With Cherry Pits](https://www.reddit.com/r/codyslab/comments/9wd4j7/video_dissolving_gold_with_cherry_pits/) experiment by using a far hardier and faster-growing plant as my source of cyanogenic glycosides (I am a massive fan of [Cody's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/user/theCodyReeder/videos)). [Sweet sorghum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_sorghum) doesn't contain Cyanogenic glycosides, but the variety I grow is a grain variety, not sweet sorghum.
2. As mentioned on the Wikipedia page on [Staple food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food), Sorghum has the potential to produce per-area yields triple that of [Maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize), and more than 8 times that of [Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice) or [Wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat). I have never been able to produce Rice or Wheat from my garden (and only low yields of Maize compared to [Potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato) or sorghum).

 [https://i.redd.it/6jgoi0r5dn131.png](https://i.redd.it/6jgoi0r5dn131.png) 

# Actual questions

* If Sorghum is so easy to grow, why isn't it a staple food in more places?
* Dry grains of Sorghum can store as well as dry grains of Rice, Wheat or Maize. Why isn't it favoured as a long-term storage crop, unlike Rice, Wheat or Maize?
* Sorghum is known for an ability to break up hard soils and grow without ploughing. So why isn't it favoured for [Desert farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_farming)? It seems like irrigated farmland in deserts are more often used to grow Rice, Wheat or Maize, which are a lot more intensive on water, fertilizers and pesticides.
* [Puffed Sorghum](https://www.goodness.com.au/organic-puffed-sorghum-2kg) is a popular health food. [You can also eat it like rice](https://www.sanitarium.com.au/health-nutrition/nutrition/sorghum). Is there a culinary property of Sorghum preventing it from becoming more popular as a staple food?
* How come Sorghum yields can potentially become extremely high, but are very variable? Isn't Sorghum's suitability for long-term storage able to mitigate the impacts of its highly variable yields?
* Since Sorghum can be grown on infertile, hard or unploughed soils, doesn't this make sweet sorghum more valuable as a biofuel or sugar source?",Real_Carl_Ramirez,askculinary,Why didnt Sorghum become as widely consumed as wheat maize or rice  BackgroundI recently came back from an  week business trip to South America I already learnt from previous experience in my garden that SorghumhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSorghumbicolor is extremely easy to grow even in infertile soils so I sowed some to grow while I was away The plan worked perfectlyhttpsiredditllrnenpnghttpsiredditllrnenpng   other reasons why I grow Sorghum Sorghum leaves contain Cyanogenic glycosideshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiGlycosideCyanogenicglycosides which can be hydrolysed to form cyanide The reason I want to do this is because I want to expand on uCodyDonhttpsnewredditcomuCodyDons Dissolving Gold With Cherry Pitshttpswwwredditcomrcodyslabcommentswdjvideodissolvinggoldwithcherrypits experiment by using a far hardier and fastergrowing plant as my source of cyanogenic glycosides I am a massive fan of Codys LabhttpswwwyoutubecomusertheCodyReedervideos Sweet sorghumhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSweetsorghum doesnt contain Cyanogenic glycosides but the variety I grow is a grain variety not sweet sorghum As mentioned on the Wikipedia page on Staple foodhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiStaplefood Sorghum has the potential to produce perarea yields triple that of MaizehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiMaize and more than  times that of RicehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiRice or WheathttpsenwikipediaorgwikiWheat I have never been able to produce Rice or Wheat from my garden and only low yields of Maize compared to PotatoeshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPotato or sorghum httpsiredditjgoirdnpnghttpsiredditjgoirdnpng  Actual questions If Sorghum is so easy to grow why isnt it a staple food in more places Dry grains of Sorghum can store as well as dry grains of Rice Wheat or Maize Why isnt it favoured as a longterm storage crop unlike Rice Wheat or Maize Sorghum is known for an ability to break up hard soils and grow without ploughing So why isnt it favoured for Desert farminghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiDesertfarming It seems like irrigated farmland in deserts are more often used to grow Rice Wheat or Maize which are a lot more intensive on water fertilizers and pesticides Puffed Sorghumhttpswwwgoodnesscomauorganicpuffedsorghumkg is a popular health food You can also eat it like ricehttpswwwsanitariumcomauhealthnutritionnutritionsorghum Is there a culinary property of Sorghum preventing it from becoming more popular as a staple food How come Sorghum yields can potentially become extremely high but are very variable Isnt Sorghums suitability for longterm storage able to mitigate the impacts of its highly variable yields Since Sorghum can be grown on infertile hard or unploughed soils doesnt this make sweet sorghum more valuable as a biofuel or sugar source,0

I'm going to be using some freeze dried pineapple powder as part of the flavour for some jerky, does anyone know if the bromelain in it is still active when the pineapple has been freeze dried, and if it will totally destroy my meat?

Usually I'd marinade my meat strips for between 6 and 24 hours and then dehydrate but I'm not sure if using the pineapple powder will turn them to mush in this time and it should be added just before drying, or if it should just be avoided at all costs (would just the moisture from the meat as soon as it's added cause an issue?). 

Does anyone have any experience with this or knowledge to drop that might help me make this work? I've googled it but can't find any useful information other than the temperatures bromelain is destroyed at and /r/jerky seems to only hold references to pineapple juice.

16,cx9hvl,"Cooking hobo packs, suggestions for ingredient variety?","This seems specific enough to post here, apologies if it belongs somewhere else. 

I work for the Outdoor Adventure program at my university, and this weekend we’re taking a trip for the holiday and for our dinner plans on Sunday we are cooking hobo packs. 

If you’re unfamiliar with hobo packs, we basically take foil packets and fill them with a variety of ingredients including ground beef, potatoes, carrots, broccoli, squash, zucchini, spices, and different condiments such as ketchup, barbecue sauce, or mustard, all based on personal preference, i.e. build your own dinner. Then the foil packets go straight on top of a pile of hot charcoals for 15 or so minutes until the meat is cooked through and the more dense vegetables or cooked enough to chew. 

Lately we’ve been having the same options to choose from that I listed above in recent trips, and I am looking for some new and different options to add to the mix. Any suggestions on ingredients that would do well with this cooking method? I’ve thought about using mushrooms, adding chopped onion or garlic, bell peppers, or even subbing the broccoli for cauliflower. To me it seems like a mix between steaming and roasting and simmering all at the same time, so I’m not totally sure what will work and what won’t.

Heat oil and butter over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pod, and three cloves, and cook until they sizzle and pop.

Add peanuts, chopped tomato, chopped Napa cabbage, ground turmeric, ground garam masala, and fresh lemon juice. Stir together and cook for a few minutes until the cabbage has begun to wilt. 

Add drained rice, salt, and 2.5 cups of water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer until rice is done. 

Remove from the heat stir, cover with a towel, and replace lid. Let sit for 10 minutes.

35,cwuzqb,"My pizza dough is very, very, sad","I've been trying to make pizzas at home, but I can't seem to get the dough right at all. I'm roughly following Basics with Babish' pizza recipe, but I'll write down what I did here in the exact values it ended up being.

I'm going to explain what I did in detail so someone can perhaps spot my mistake:

So, starting with the dough:

* \~510g flour (regular all-purpose flour from Albert Heijn)
* 350ml water
* 12g salt (I ran out before getting to 16g)
* 4g active-dry yeast

During my first attempt the no-knead recipe didn't work at all, so this time I kneaded. I mixed it together and kneaded it for over 10 minutes. This is a 70% hydration dough so I know it's supposed to be somewhat sticky, but I could never get even close to a consistent dough ball. Eventually I just put it in the bowl to rise. I did the kneading on an unfloured kitchen top, to avoid working more flour into it.

I let it rise for 24 hours, at room temperature. It was relatively warm, reaching up to 30 C during the day. I noticed that it did rise, but then collapsed again.

This is where the problems started.

By the time I took the dough out of the bowl, it seemed way more sticky and fluid than it was even at the start of kneading. It was ridiculous, almost more like a really thick stew than dough. I couldn't even remotely hope to cut it into individual pieces, let alone form it into dough balls.

I tried kneading it for a while, trying to avoid crying at the loss of all the air pockets, but I had to do something to get it to be workable. Even after another 10 minutes of kneading, it wasn't staying together enough to cut. I could with quite a lot of effort just barely separate it into 4 parts.

I made an attempt at forming it into a pizza. Forming it into a dough ball just completely failed, it stuck to the table way too much. After covering it in flour and trying to flatten it a bit, I just couldn't pick it up at all to stretch it out. I would pick up a bit and it would just fall apart.

It took working in significant amount of extra flour to get it even remotely close to workable, but it still continued to be very brittle. It kept getting holes in it and in the end it fell apart partially in the oven, basically tearing in two, coating my pizza stone in another layer of burned tomato sauce and pepperoni, ew.

So, what am I doing wrong here? Should I be kneading more? Was the rise too long? Is 70% hydration just too much? I've tried this multiple times now with similar results every time. I'm at my wits end and can't find any information, my dough just seems to be completely different from what other people are getting.",LaylC,askculinary,My pizza dough is very very sad Ive been trying to make pizzas at home but I cant seem to get the dough right at all Im roughly following Basics with Babish pizza recipe but Ill write down what I did here in the exact values it ended up beingIm going to explain what I did in detail so someone can perhaps spot my mistakeSo starting with the dough g flour regular allpurpose flour from Albert Heijn ml water g salt I ran out before getting to g g activedry yeastDuring my first attempt the noknead recipe didnt work at all so this time I kneaded I mixed it together and kneaded it for over  minutes This is a  hydration dough so I know its supposed to be somewhat sticky but I could never get even close to a consistent dough ball Eventually I just put it in the bowl to rise I did the kneading on an unfloured kitchen top to avoid working more flour into itI let it rise for  hours at room temperature It was relatively warm reaching up to  C during the day I noticed that it did rise but then collapsed againThis is where the problems startedBy the time I took the dough out of the bowl it seemed way more sticky and fluid than it was even at the start of kneading It was ridiculous almost more like a really thick stew than dough I couldnt even remotely hope to cut it into individual pieces let alone form it into dough ballsI tried kneading it for a while trying to avoid crying at the loss of all the air pockets but I had to do something to get it to be workable Even after another  minutes of kneading it wasnt staying together enough to cut I could with quite a lot of effort just barely separate it into  partsI made an attempt at forming it into a pizza Forming it into a dough ball just completely failed it stuck to the table way too much After covering it in flour and trying to flatten it a bit I just couldnt pick it up at all to stretch it out I would pick up a bit and it would just fall apartIt took working in significant amount of extra flour to get it even remotely close to workable but it still continued to be very brittle It kept getting holes in it and in the end it fell apart partially in the oven basically tearing in two coating my pizza stone in another layer of burned tomato sauce and pepperoni ewSo what am I doing wrong here Should I be kneading more Was the rise too long Is  hydration just too much Ive tried this multiple times now with similar results every time Im at my wits end and cant find any information my dough just seems to be completely different from what other people are getting,0

Problem is, I either get a wet and not ""done"" top and a perfect bottom, or I get a lightly brown colored bottom which tastes kinda mushy ( overcooked ) and a well done top. 

Once or twice I hit the jackpott by accident and since I know how great it can taste I really wanna get it on point again.

So question is, what might I be doing wrong?

I think its either using not enough ( or maybe too much? ) heat in the pan ( i do it on a mid heat, 4 out of 6 ) or I'm not stirring enough. But If i would be stirring more, i couldn't form the scraps into an omelette anymore.

Here is what I do step for step:

I heat butter in a pan on medium heat, add my herb &amp; egg mixture and start stirring clockwise in small circles while moving the pan forward and backward. I salt when the egg starts to solidify and only stop stirring when most of the egg is already solid. Then I use my spatula to and pan tilting to form it into an omelette and put my cheese on top of it.

58,cwe0e4,My masa corn tortillas are coming out tough like shoe leather instead of soft and supple like... corn tortillas.,"My goal is to make some tortilla chips from “scratch”. However, I’m unable to reproduce a tortilla that I would consider a good starting point similar to chips I make from store-bought tortillas. Maseca (white and green bag) and water have been the main ingredients — although I’ve also tried different variations of salt and baking powder as well. 

My most successful process has been: 

- masa, water, salt, and baking powder kneaded for 5 mins then covered in a wet paper towel for 60mins in order to allow the corn flour to hydrate

- 1.2-1.5g balls of dough pressed that the edges aren’t cracked. If cracked, I’ll add water to my fingers before rolling and pressing again  

- Heat cast iron up to the high 400° range. 45 second/flip/60s/flip/30s/flip/45s for 3 minutes tota before removing from heat to cool for 60 minutes either air-dried or in a tea towel  

- 375° oil that drops to 350° for 90-120 seconds. 

The 2 main differences between mine vs. store-bought chips are:

a.) softness out of the bag - which I’m never able to achieve. My tortillas, for lack of a better term, feel ‘leathery’. 

b.) when I fry them and a chip forms the large bubble, after I let it rest, store-tilla bubbles are crispy and delicious whereas mine as tough and you need to rip through it like jerky. 

At this point I’m not sure whereabout in the process that I’m going wrong. It feels like a moisture problem - somewhere - but I’m not sure which variable I need to change to fix it properly. Any helpful suggestions or thoughts for me to try?

81,cvjnc8,"Great Grandmothers roast ""the french way""","My great grandmother used to make a roast for holidays when I was younger. At least we called it roast, but it is unlike any roast i have ever found since. She always cooked before we got to her house so i don't actually know how it was made, which is why i am here. I'l list what details i can remember and hopefully someone here will have some insight. 

Great Grandmother was from Louisiana and spoke English as her second language. And I only speak English. So what we called her food in English was poorly translated at best.

I know it was usually made from a good size beef chuck roast, though i know she sometimes made a pork roast cooked the same way. 

She cooked it in a big old cast iron dutch oven. But it was done entirely on the stove top. I know there was oil involved. It started out as regular vegetable oil but by the time the roast was done it was pretty blackened and we would spoon it over white rice for flavor. It was pretty tasty. Great Grandma called it ""the juice from the roast""  

The roast was eaten with white rice and black eye peas.

I know it was seasoned with salt,pepper, and a bit of cayenne, and she cut pockets into the meat and shoved garlic in there.

The roast itself was always very dark. Like nearly black. But I wouldn't say it was burnt. it was just so cooked that it was super mega dark.

I know she put vinegar on the meat at some point in the cooking process.

That's basically all i can remember. I tried to cook a roast like this from what i could remember and it came out a tough chewy burned mess. I am not a culinary expert so i don't even know what kind of keywords to start googling to try to learn how this roast was done. All i keep finding are pot roasts where you sear and then boil and none of those look like this roast at all. 

If someone recognizes this way of cooking and has anything to add that might point me in the right direction it would really mean a lot. Thanks for your time.

Edit: DaMysteriousMustache said something about braising. After some quick googling I think these recipes look a lot closer to what i was expecting. Im gonna explore this a bit as its a new cooking technique to me. Thanks everyone.

Edit 2- Woke up, called my old man, adding a couple details :I got ahold of my father, who had little to add unfortunately, but I was able to confirm the use of vinegar after an initial step of browning the meat considerably. He was able to remember Great Grandma saying she would add vinegar and Great Grandma would say that ""it will go pshhhhh"" and it would steam up for a moment and she'd cover it with the lid.
Also worth pointing out that both of us are pretty sure this recipe does not include Roux. We are both pretty familiar with dirty rice and gumbo and this is very much not a roux based recipe. 

Great Grandmother was originally from the Lafayette area in Louisianna and her primary language is French.

Someone suggested she may have just bought the food before we came to her house. This is not the case. Of this I am quite certain. She was just from an older generation. It was expected in their house that the Husband worked and the wife had a hot meal ready when he came home. Men didn't do the cooking, therefor my father and myself were never included.

And I just want to point out that this post has gotten way more feedback than I expected. The braising recipes  look promising. But also that confit recipe that was linked looks interesting. Im still not sure on anything though. This is some old school cooking and im still trying to figure it out. I want to thank everyone again for all the feedback.

88,cvjakf,Hokkaido milk bread failure - dough was dry and hard. What did I do wrong?,"I'm sorry for not including a photo, I already threw my dough out. I used [this recipe for Hokkaido milk bread](https://mildlymeandering.com/hokkaido-milk-bread-shokupan/) and I thought I did everything right, but apparently I didn't or else I wouldn't be here!

This was also my first time ever making bread, so I figured it wasn't going to come out right. I watched a couple videos on making milk bread just so I knew what to expect along the way and from what I understand, bread dough should be kind of stretchy, squishy and maybe a little sticky? Mine was dry and tough, sort of like refrigerated sugar cookie dough that hadn't come to room temperature yet. I had a lot of trouble kneading it.

I think there are a few things that might have caused this, but I don't know which one(s) could be the culprit:

* I cooked the roux too long. The recipe says 4-5 minutes on medium heat until the roux reaches the consistency of mashed potatoes (or pudding, which another recipe described). I cooked mine for much longer trying to achieve that consistency, but when I had reduced about 1/2 cup of liquid down to a scant tablespoon of roux, I figured I should call it done before it disappeared entirely.

* I used dry milk powder to make the liquid milk instead of normal liquid milk.

* I didn't use a stand mixer - I kneaded by hand. I didn't know how to translate mixer minutes to hand kneading minutes, so I just did five and five like the recipe said. Not that a stand mixer would have helped because the dough was much too tough to mix anyway. It would have just stuck to the hook attachment. Some places I looked at suggested that tough dough is from overkneading, but there's no way that was the case with my dough because it was tough from the start.

* Problem with the yeast. As far as I know it wasn't expired or anything, but the recipe didn't say to do anything special with it.

* Crappy recipe. Doubtful since people seemed to say good things about it.

I had the thighs sitting on the rack in the fridge since yesterday evening to dry brine, I already noticed some tiny grey specks of grey when they were raw,  only where the meat pressed the most on the rack.

Then I put the thighs in the oven on the same rack, and when they were done I noticed the rack had left some discoloration again, but this time more as you can see in the pic, the discoloration was a whole line wherever the meat was touching the rack.

I removed the discolored bits by scraping the meat a bit, and other than this the thighs tasted normal.

For the future, is was what happened normal, or should I get another rack?

Thanks :)

One thing that bothered me in the recipe however is the use of ""non hydrogenated shortening"", I don't have access to it and I'd rather not use shortenings.

If I recall correctly, from my understanding most of these kinds of spreads use either palm oil or shea butter or both. Unfortunately I don't have access to these ingredients either.

I was wondering if anyone has any idea for a good substitute that will not affect the texture. Things that were brought up in my mind were coconut oil, cocoa butter and ghee. I suppose butter is not a good idea as it would turn bad pretty quickly if not stored in the fridge, and storing it in the fridge would make the texture stiff.

Also is it important to use refined oils rather than natural to not affect the flavour? Would it affect the flavour significantly?

123,cvcq5e,"Thoughts on/experience with using an air fryer as a ""better"" convection oven (not a substitute for frying)?","I'm really, really interested in getting an air fryer (specifically the mini dash, I'm just cooking for one or two)...but not because I want it to use it as a substitute for frying. I'm not big on frying foods because it's messy and I hate my house smelling like oil, so although making veggie fries and stuff is nice, that's not why I want it. I want it because it seems to be an even better mini convection oven. Since I'm only cooking for one or two people, I almost never end up roasting veggies or even baking much in general because the oven takes so long to heat up and I don't like making large batches of food (reheated broccoli tastes nasty to me but I LOVE freshly roasted broccoli and cauliflower). So for one, the sound of being able to quickly roast small amounts of vegetables and have them be extra crisp because of the all around air flow (getting underneath the food) sounds awesome.

I also love the idea of being able to make meatballs in the air fryer. I love making meatballs, but I don't like browning them stovetop because it's uneven and makes a fucking mess. Broiling is my go-to, but the bottoms end up soggy and turning them ruins the crispy brown top. Restaurants deep fry their meatballs to get them perfect and golden brown, and again, I feel like this is where the air fryer could shine.

I would also love to make crispy tofu bites (I would eat these regularly) and maybe toast my sandwiches (my toaster oven burns things, and I figured I could spend the money on the air fryer instead of a different toaster oven) and make crispy potstickers.

I've also heard it's good for baking. If it heats up quickly and cooks faster, I would LOVE to be able to make 1-3 serving mini baked goods for myself (pies, bread, muffins, etc) without feeling like I'm being wasteful (time and resource-wise) using the regular oven. Like I'm just imagining how awesome it would be to make up a large batch of dough in my fridge and just mini-bake two dinner rolls each night or one cinnamon roll for breakfast in the morning.

Thoughts? Do you find that air fryers work well for these functions, and do they possibly even work better than ovens for these types of dishes

142,cuxlym,Making stock in a slow cooker,"I came by some marrow bones at the market and bought 3 lbs of them. I threw them in my slow cooker covered with water and let it go for 12 hours. 

I started to look into making a good stock and I found that both the marrow bones I got were poor for stock lacking collagen AND slow cookers were poor for stock because they wouldn't get high enough temp to extract enough collagen. They also wouldn't allow any amount of evaporation leaving a thin bodied stock that wouldn't gel up fully in the fridge (neither of these things happened).

To my surprise my broth/stock tasted amazing AND formed into a very thick gel when cooled (apparently a sign you did it perfectly).

I THINK this is because after 12 hours on low I decided to do 8 hours on HIGH even though every where I looked every single recipe for slow cooker broth/stock said LOW heat. I added vegetables and aromatics ~3 hours before finishing.

Maybe it's just my brand of slowcooker (black and decker) but HIGH heat achieved a very gentle simmer that emulated a stove top stockpot method.

Is this result an anomaly? According to the internet I should've gotten a poor broth both with the bones and slow cooker, but I didn't. I want to do this again, should I just put it on high from the get go and let it go 12+ hours?

174,cuimy7,What is the best approach for egg whites in eggnog?,"It's time to start thinking about aging eggnog, and I'm looking for advice about how to handle the egg whites. Some people like [Alton Brown forgo the egg whites entirely](https://altonbrown.com/eggnog-recipe/), but I am going to incorporate them to lighten the drink (but maybe do a 2:1 ratio of yolks to whites.)

My general strategy is to combine the eggs, sugar, and alcohol and age them to make it food safe and improve flavor. Fresh dairy is added when it's time to serve.

Here are some potential approaches for the egg whites:

 * Whip the whites with the egg yolks.

 * Whip the whites to soft peaks but fold into the whipped yolks. Does the texture hold up after aging? Will this become light again if I whip it when it's time to serve?

 * Don't whip the whites but add them to whipped yolks. Whip this when it's time to serve. Would this create a better texture than whipping the whites beforehand?

 * Don't whip the whites but age them in a separate bottle (with its corresponding alcohol and sugar). Would this whip up after aging?

175,cujbk7,What are some foods I can make black for my anniversary coming up? Or a resource where I can better understand how to do so?,"My wife loves the color black, so for our anniversary I wanted to serve her a meal that consists of only black foods, and hopefully some of it that isn't normally black.

I know about squid ink pasta, and that there's some breads that are already normally black. Cake could be a nice after treat. I read that food coloring is better with paler foods, so maybe mashed potatoes. And I've seen shrimp died really vibrant colors, and they're pretty pale so I'm guessing they might be a good choice.

So I guess I envision a meal with a shrimp pasta and bread, and cake afterwards, but that feels like it's lacking a little, and I'm not familiar with what all my options are, so I wanted to know what else I could add, or if there's an even better path.

My handy dandy Food Substitutions Bible ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Substitutions-Bible-Ingredients-Techniques/dp/0778802450)) tells me I can substitute weight-for-weight of zucchini, yellow squash, or portobello mushrooms. Cool. Those vegetables are in heavy rotation in my house. Are there any other vegetables worth checking out as potential substitutes? The only other food allergy I have are bananas/plantains. 

Reading these recipes got me thinking about ingredient substitutions in general. Some substitutions are pretty straight forward; dark leafy greens like collard or turnip for kale, guanciale or bacon for pancetta, nectarines for peaches, etc. But what if you're trying to substitute something not quite so comparable? How can you tell if the new ingredient will work for the technique/recipe? I get how portobello caps could reasonably approximate eggplant parm but I can't see how they would work for the smoky eggplant dip I linked. Is it just a matter of trial and error or is there some rule one follows?

199,ctpf7y,How to do a deep clean of a KitchenAid pasta roller?,"I've had a pasta roller attachment for a while now and there's some buildup inside the rollers that I can't get out. I tried brushing it and picking at it after letting it dry for a couple days but there's a cavity in there that has trapped dough pieces and it sounds like a maraca when I shake it. Hand cranking the driver while shaking it only loosened a few pieces that aren't actually trapped in there.

For some background, I use it primarily for ramen noodle doughs so it's pretty much just flour and water, no raw eggs to worry about. I figured if I left it that way, it will start impacting the rollers and might actually start causing some sanitary concerns.

Has anyone taken apart their rollers to clean before? I've tried looking around online and the closest I see are people who just pop the covers off to replace the shear shaft and don't go any further. I'd start taking it apart if I knew there wasn't some irreversible mechanism that will fall apart and gets difficult to re-assemble.

214,cu29av,Orange curd plus mistakes. How do you think this will turn out?,"I'm just posting this for fun. I'll let you guys know how this turns out.

It's fig season and I wanted to make a fig tart. I've done a tart like this once before with lemon curd and raspberries, but thought orange would be better with figs than lemons. I looked up a recipe for lemon curd and thought I'd just replace lemons with oranges. Since orange doesn't have as much oomph as lemon, I decided to add more zest and a bit of orange liqueur.

I used a double boiler with the water at a low simmer, water was not touching my metal bowl top. I messed up and added everything, butter included, all at the beginning when the recipe said to add butter off heat when the egg yolk custard was finished.

After constant stirring, my curd thickened super fast, in about 2 minutes instead of the 10 that the recipe predicted. I had a couple tiny chunks of scrambled yolk in there. I strained it out and it's sitting in the fridge to thicken further.

Any ideas on how it will turn out? How bad is it to add butter in the beginning? How bad is it that this cooked so quickly?

I'll update when I assemble the tart, but I've never had orange curd before and don't have much of a comparison.

222,ctvr2d,Sorbet with Framboise: tasty but why is it hard as a rock?,"Home cook here. I've made blackberry sorbet twice this week, and both batches have turned out hard as rocks. Seriously. Like igloo bricks.

I modified the recipe for both batches by using Monk fruit 1:1 in place of sugar. I also substituted 2T of Framboise, which has an alcohol content of 16.5%, rather than using bourbon or vodka (alcohol content: ~40%) for 2T of the water. No alcohol was called for in the recipe (which says it yield a very soft, creamy sorbet); I added because alcohol raises the freezing point of ice cream to keep it scoopable. 

I don't think the Monk fruit was the issue - the flavor was fine. Two questions:
1. Is the low alcohol content the problem?

Thanks.",TobyCat88,askculinary,Sorbet with Framboise tasty but why is it hard as a rock Home cook here Ive made blackberry sorbet twice this week and both batches have turned out hard as rocks Seriously Like igloo bricksI modified the recipe for both batches by using Monk fruit  in place of sugar I also substituted T of Framboise which has an alcohol content of  rather than using bourbon or vodka alcohol content  for T of the water No alcohol was called for in the recipe which says it yield a very soft creamy sorbet I added because alcohol raises the freezing point of ice cream to keep it scoopable I dont think the Monk fruit was the issue  the flavor was fine Two questions Is the low alcohol content the problem Does alcohol of any type just not work in sorbetRecipeMake a simple syrup with Monk fruit  water add berries allow to cook briefly Cool then blend and strain stir in lemon juice Cool then mix in cream maker Thanks,0

Are there any umami tips? maybe for rehydrating the mushrooms?  I may have some chanterelles dried too.  I have red miso, coconut aminos and sesame oil.  And a wide variety of spices

277,csl8d7,Kosher and Halal restrictions in baking.,"A friend of mine is an ESL teacher, and school is starting up again soon. She said that if I ever happened to bake too much of something, I could send it in to her class. Most of her students are Middle Eastern/South Asian refugees, and as such, most of them are Muslim or Jewish. If I wanted to make them some cookies, I know I would have to follow Kosher/Halal guidelines, and I've googled, but everything I've read is very vague. I'm very concerned about following these restrictions, as I don't want any of her students to feel excluded, so I guess I want to know what specifically I need to do.

I know I can't prepare anything with utensils or apparatus that have been used with meat or non-kosher/haram ingredients. Would I have to use new ones, or is there a way of cleaning these things that would satisfy these requirements? Does that extend to the baking pans as well as bowls and measuring utensils and that?

The ingredients I worry the most about are butter and eggs, which I can get from a local halal market. Would those also be considered kosher, or should I make separate batches?

I want to make Maamoul cookies, which I know are traditionally made with dates. If I wanted to make another fruit filling so there's some variety (say, apples or figs) are there any restrictions on those? (For example, no pesticides or something?)

If I wanted to make them some traditionally American cookies, I'd probably do chocolate chip. Any restrictions as far as chocolate goes for either set of restrictions?

286,csl0os,Putting a thick veggie soup into a savory pie,"(Mods, please remove if not allowed, but I think this falls within the stated rules.)

So I made something really gross a few nights ago. It was a casserole with veggies (carrots, green beans, onions, beet greens, &amp; purselane from the garden) and some canned cream of mushroom soup. I had wanted to add some kick, so I added what I thought was a dash of red pepper flakes. It was not a dash. Not only did the purslane stems not get tender (I am new to cooking it), but it was way too spicy.

So I took half of the leftover casserole and made it into a soup and added lots of water and potatoes to spread out the spice. It was not great, and we got sick of it quickly. 

Now I am waiting on some bread dough to rise, and my plan is to put the remainder into some kind of British-style savory pie, as the casserole is pretty thick. I might add some potatoes to the mix as well to spread out the spice. 

Does anyone have any tips and tricks as to how to make a pie with a filling that has already been cooked once? Should I form the dough with an open top, par bake, and then add the filling and bake some more? Should I expect to bake it just as long as I would if I were making the dough into bread as I normally would? When and how should I add the potatoes? Should I cook them on the stovetop before baking everything?

And any further tips on making this thing edible would be much appreciated. I don't like to waste food even when I have admittedly made something disgusting.

312,crwj9s,What Happens to Meat as it Cooks and Rests?,"hi r/AskCulinary. I have been doing a lot of reading on meat science and what happens to muscles as they cook, but am having trouble understanding what exactly is going on. I've been told that muscles contract and squeeze water out of the meat. But also that the proteins denature, which to me seems like the opposite of contracting; and if muscles aren't contracting, how does the water end up escaping? SeriousEats says the water does not flow towards the center of the meat, and that makes sense to me as meat never increases in size/volume when cooked.

Additionally what happens when meat rests? The people who say that the juices that get pushed to the center of the meat then get redistributed all throughout it as the meat rests. Others say that the muscle fibers get to relax and stop contracting as the meat rests/temp drops and the juices are re-absorbed. These seem like polar opposite explanations. Some even say resting meat doesn't do anything at all.

Can anyone give me a breakdown of what happens exactly to the muscles as meat both cooks and rests, and why? Also while we're at it, does wrapping meat in foil as it cooks help it retain moisture? I'm not sure if it does, but whenever I wrap chicken thighs in foil when grilling them, they seem to come out more tender and moist.

328,crw6h2,Need Review and Suggestions for 3-Course Meal,"I'm cooking a nice dinner for my grandmother's birthday and I was thinking of making her a nice 3-course dinner, was going to ask in here if anyone had their own suggestions for recipe tweaking both due to personal experience, and since what I'm going to do to the steak might be a bit...weird.

Also, does anyone know if there are any programs where you can map out how to cook a multi-course meal? Like I have x pots and pans, this dish will take my time to cook and this dish needs z prep work, etc.

Anyways, the appetizer will be two-part; 

* Firstly, a caprese following [this recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-cherry-tomato-caprese), though I might try to cook the tomatoes a little less in order to make them more stable; putting them on a toothpick alongside a small mozzarella ball and a basil leaf. I'm not sure if I should use any glaze or vinaigrette...

* Secondly, [Duchess Potatoes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/duchess_potatoes/). I was thinking of serving them with a pan sauce made from the steak from the main course.

Onto the main course. This would be two-part as well.

* The first portion would be a combination of things I've tried before. I used this recipe for [Chaliapin Steak](https://cookingwithdog.com/recipe/chaliapin-steak/) before which turned out well. However, my grandmother mentioned - and I had recently looked into - tenderizing beef cuts with pineapple juice. How well would it work if I marinated the steak in a combination of pineapple juice and onions for about 2 hours or so, drained everything, then washed off both the steak and onion cuts before finishing the recipe above?

* Technically part of the above. Instead of just dropping the onions into the beef drippings and fond, I would toss in some butter and aromatics before deglazing with beef stock to make it into a gravy/ pot sauce. This would be used for both beef cuts, the potatoes, and some would be used for the onions in the above recipe.

* This one is a touch odd, but I've been looking forward to trying it. I would use this recipe for [Individual Beef Wellington](https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/individual-beef-wellington/), which basically uses filet mignon instead of larger beef cuts. I'd also be substituting chopped up ground chestnuts instead of mushrooms.

Finally, desert.

* I hear cheesecake pairs well with steak. However, my grandmother likes grapes and I found this, though I'm not sure how well this might pair WITH steaks. Basically it's a [No Bake Grape-Cheesecake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSMNP4aUBAg) .

349,crna4k,Undercooked croissants,"Hi guys,

I decided to make croissants for the first time, but sadly they turned out undercooked in the middle. 
Pic: https://imgur.com/FzvNY1m

Recipe that I used had the following ingredients:

250g of flour

130g of water

6g of active dry yeast

1 egg yolk

25g of lightly melted butter

30g of sugar

5g of salt

And 140g of butter. 


To be fair I don't really think that the recipe is bad or anything. I made sure that before each fold the dough and butter were properly chilled  (I waited 30minutes before each fold). 
After the final fold I shaped the croissants and let them proof for more than 1 hour. During that time they noticeably increased their size and were wiggly. Gave them a egg wash and was ready to put them in the oven. And here is the mistake that I think fucked my croissants. 
I preheated the oven to 200C (400F) with the setting ""up and down"" (symbol with the straight lines at the top and the bottom). 
The recipe said I should bake them for 15-20 minutes at that temperature. So I did. At 15 minute mark the croissants were brown and beautiful. I took one, chcecked the middle and it was heavily undercooked (way worse that on the pic) . I decided to keep them for 10 more minutes but during that time they browned really hard and the middle was still not cooked. I took them out, let them sit for 10 minutes and the middle was looking like on that pic above–better than after 15 minutes but still bad.

351,crmojp,Wanting to improve our End of Summer Feast game - any suggestions for good all-day outdoor cooking?,"For the last five years my friends from college and I have been gathering at a summer house to catchup and have a big end-of-summer bonfire chowdown. We usually do a big seafood barbeque - crabs, langoustines, a selection of oily fish - with homemade focaccia and roasted garlic in the coals. It's usually pretty simple, just good fresh produce with some nice butter, lemon and herbs.

In recent years, though, now where we have decent paying jobs, we have been upping our alcohol game - some nice orange wine followed by increasingly good whisky. This year, though, I think it's time to up the food game as well. At least half of us are keen cooks, and so we like a good, all-day challenge. I've been googling around this for hours, with little luck. All the suggestions online are for 'easy', 'quick' and 'simple' dishes for summer feasts, but that's not what we're about! There's always the old advice to stick to what you know, but we do this once a year, and we like a good challenge, especially if the meal is one of those ones you can only achieve outdoors or  by splashing a bit more cash than usual.

I've thought about switching out the seafood for a suckling pig cooked over the fire, but that decision might be Controversial, at best. A few of us aren't big on the heavy meats, but the same fish supper every year is getting a bit dull. I found some good ideas on bon appetit for marinating whole veg in picking juice before charring it on the grill, which sounds like a good suggestion. I doubt the alcohol choice will be much different this year, but the weather has been a bit colder. In general, I'd just love for some suggestions! Give me your best shot!

* Stock

376,cqtkav,Pie is undercooked on bottom and overcooked on top. How can I fix this?,"I'm using an all butter + vinegar recipe that tastes great, with a fruit filling, and a crumble top. Everything tastes great and sets well. However, I'm having 2 issues, listed below. Here are my steps to pie right now:

1. Make dough, form disks, refrigerate for 10-12 hours
2. Roll out disk into pie crust, lay in chilled pie pan, brush bottom with egg white, cover and refrigerate for 2 more hours
3. Add filling, brush crimped edge with cream, and place onto preheated pizza stone in a convection oven preheated to 425. I use an in-oven thermometer instead of relying on digital display. Bake for 20 mins
4. Reduce heat to 375, add crumble topping to pie, cover pie with foil shaped like an inverted bowl with an X cut at the top for venting. Bake for 1 hour longer. At this point, when I check the pie from underneath via glass pan, I see golden brown color on the sloped edges and the outer .5"" circumference of bottom circle and the rest of the circle is still pretty white
5. Keep baking for 30 minutes longer until 75% of bottom circle is golden brown and the other 25% is a spotted golden brown. Perhaps I should keep baking here.

&amp;#x200B;

The Issues

1. Bottom is seemingly underdone &amp; overdone at the same time. [Here are photos.](https://imgur.com/a/GHP9Oji) The crust looks brown from the bottom when you look at it through the glass pan, more brown on the exterior rim of the bottom circle than middle (maybe that's the issue, I should keep baking?). So when you cut a slice, you have a too-brown, overdone, maybe baked-all-the-fat-out crust on the crimped edge, where the pie crust slopes down into the pan, and then it becomes underdone as you go to the center.
2. Crimped edge gets too brown, even after I cover it with foil after it gets the proper color. Normally I love browned crust but this is for a pie contest and most of those pies are a light golden brown. I have 2 ideas here that I would appreciate advice on:

\- cover the crimped edge with foil before baking. However, I'm not sure if this will have a negative effect. Will it in anyway prevent the edge from creating those flaky layers that you see in my pictures? If not, then I can do this and remove foil in the last 15-20 mins of baking if I need to add more color.

\- bake at a lower heat like 325 for longer. With this solution, I'm worried that my bottom is never be done properly and thoroughly.

It still tastes fine and looks fine but the smell is off putting for me so I end up throwing away half a cake every time I make one (which has been increasingly uncommon because of this).

As for ingredients used it varies between which cake is made but the most recent one was just a yellow box cake but we substituted some simple ingredients to make it denser (like butter instead of oil or something like that but no baking soda or anything).

My main concern is juiciness considering I am using pattys that were made a while back, frozen, and just defrosted today.

Do you all think a frozen and defrosted patty is suitable for making a smashburger or will some of the juice/water be lost and thus resulting in a burnt mess? Also, I'm kind of confused as to whether I should oil my cast iron or not. It's reasonably seasoned although I wouldn't say I'm confident to call it well seasoned, but Kenji seems to imply you want to avoid oiling a pan before smashing a burger.

Question first: how do commercial bakeries (legally) keep filled pastries/baked goods non-refrigerated or non-heat-lamped? I've seen it pretty often- on open countertops, open sheet pan racks - with seemingly non-shelf-stable fillings: e.g. cream cheese, fresh strawberries/fruit, whip cream, key lime, fresh bananas, sausages, bacon etc.

Brief introduction: I have had a moderately productive small baking business for 2-3 years where I bake out of my home and sell ""non-potentially hazardous baked goods"" (bread, non-filled pastries, high-sugar/high-acid filled pastries, etc) at inspected farmers markets. From this, I have learned first-hand the particular (and can be kinda scary) nature of the health inspector. I am in the early stages of scaling up to a small brick &amp; mortar - and am planning the early menu and logitics. I really want to include some filled pastries/baked goods - but I am not sure how bakeries do this. Are they making sure they only sit out for 2 hours and then working constantly behind the scenes to fill them as they sell? I was under the impression most baked goods are fully prepared before the bakery opens.

This is my first attempt and I can't get my lychee pate de fruit to solidify into a gelatin block. This is the recipe I follow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_oXzucxIg 

Ingredients: 
I basically halve the recipe. 

* 250g of Lychee puree minus the pulp
* 285g of raw organic sugar (35g reserved for the pectin)
* 9g Hoosier Farms pectin
* 9g of lime juice
* 50g corn syrup

I pretty much followed the same steps. 

* Add the fruit puree on a cold pan
* Add half of the sugar
* Add the rest of the sugar
* As the sugars dissolved in the mixture, I add the pectin + sugar mix.
* Add the corn syrup
* As soon as it starts bubbling furiously and reaches 106C, I removed it from the heat and add the lime juice. Then, I poured into my mold.

I let it rest overnight on the counter and the next day, it had a texture of jam. So, I decided to reheat and add another mixture of sugar + pectin.

494,cof1wc,"Have a great idea, need help with execution - tear me apart!","I have an idea for a beautiful hors d'oeuvre. 

My idea is to make a crostini using a slice of rustic baguette, topped with a buttery mixture of half high-quality smoked oyster and half fresh sauteed duxelles of mushrooms sautéed with onions, shallots, garlic, parsley and finished with some nice aged parm. All covered and baked in a layer of soft smoked Gouda.

For the duxelles, I plan to start by sauteeing the finely chopped mushroom (I'm thinking morels), onions and shallots first, then adding garlic and parsley near the end.  Once that's done, I want to add a load of finely chopped, high quality, canned smoked oysters, as well as a chunk of butter and a good dose of salt and pepper, to get things setting together.

I plan to dress the crostini with a hearty portion of the oyster duxelles, then lay a thick slice of smoked Gouda on top, and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. 

What do you think? Should I add seasoning to the duxelles, like onion powder or garlic powder? What would you do differently? How can I kick it up a notch?

523,cnxbbh,Can I use leftover water after blanching vegetables as vegetable broth?,"Hello,

I had a zucchini glut and just finished blanching and freezing around 16 lbs of zucchini. When I went to dump out the water I blanched with, I noticed that it smelled really good, so I decided to freeze some of it. Would this be useable as a replacement for vegetable  broth? I have two concerns: 1. The recipe I used to freeze the zucchini said not to put salt in the water because doing that would negatively affect the texture of the zucchini after it is thawed, so  I didn't. Salt seems like a key aspect of broth, although maybe I could add some after defrosting. 2. While the liquid smelled very good, it's one note, ie it doesn't have the melded smell several vegetables as is the case with regular vegetable broth.

When I'm eating at a cheaper place where the only service you get is the food then dropping your conversation and saying ""thank you"" seems reasonable.

But the fancier you eat the more often you'll be serviced, and I start feeling silly when I stop talking,
wait for waitstaff to serve me, say thanks and then continue my conversation every single time a server comes to
fill up a wine glass/water glas or serves food/condiment/whatever.

Especially if there's multiple waitstaff and other people at the table also wait... I've been to dinners where
I've spent half the time silent (waiting for servers to ""be done"") and I'm thinking that I have to be doing
something wrong. Should I completely ignore the waitstaff and continue on with my conversation? Should I
acknowledge by looking in their direction? Should I stay silent for a short second but not say thanks every
single time?

## EARL GREY MUFFIN RECIPE

### INGREDIENTS

yield: 12 muffins

time: 40 minutes

2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 cup granulated sugar

1/2 tsp salt

1 tbsp baking powder

1 cup milk

1/4 cup vegetable oil

2 large eggs

2 tsp vanilla

2 earl grey tea bags 

1 tsp loose earl grey tea leaves, finely ground (optional)

### DIRECTIONS

Pre-heat oven to 500F.

Measure out 1 cup of milk in a liquid measuring cup, and microwave for 1 minute (or alternatively heat up in a small saucepan). Remove, add tea bags and steep for at least 10 minutes, or up to half an hour. Let steep longer or use an extra tea bag for a stronger earl grey flavor.

Mix together dry ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, tea leaves).

Add the rest of the liquid ingredients (vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla) to the measuring cup with the milk, and beat until light. If you used a measuring cup with a lip above the 2 cup mark, you can even measure and beat your ingredients in the same cup! Less cleanup! 

Pour wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and blend with a whisk or fork for 20 seconds. It's okay if there are a few small clumps left.

Fill a lightly greased or lined muffin tin to 2/3 or 3/4 of the way full. Place the muffins in the oven and immediately drop the temperature down to 400F. Bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.

660,cloezf,What exactly have I been making (categorize my recipe),"First off, I am NOT a “cook” and I make very few things on my own, and what I do make is very simple. I use an instant pot for my meal prep, and I’ve been making some sort of meal with the following ingredients (general amounts, I eyeball everything; and sorry, imperial as opposed to metric):

- 1 can prepared black beans, strained
- 2-3 cups green/red lentils
- 2.5 lb frozen chicken
- granulated garlic
- cumin
- salt 
- paprika
- 2-3 cups water (I used to use chicken broth, but I ended up liking using just water more)

I shred the chicken after the instant pot finishes, add it back in, and stir it together until it’s relatively homogenous. I also add some cheddar cheese (1 cup) and stir it in at the end.

It reminds me of the consistency of beef chili that I used to have as a kid - pretty much just goop - but I know that calling it something it’s not can be sacrilege. I just want to know what to call what I’m making. Also, I didn’t intend to make anything specific - I’m just trying things and keeping what tastes good, so I apologize if this is a bastardization of some other recipe.

701,cl845b,Is waiting to salt mushrooms overrated?,"Conventional wisdom states that when sauteing mushrooms, one must wait until the end to salt them, or else the salt will draw out moisture and inhibit browning. [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/mushrooms-common-mistakes) in particular really thinks this.

None of this makes any sense to me, and contrasts with my conventional logic: mushrooms have a lot of water, so you *should* salt them as early and as generously as possible to draw as much water out as possible, that way you can cook off the water and then begin the browning process as early as possible. I use this technique every time, and notice no huge difference between this and when I salt at the end. 

Am I going bonkers? How come waiting to salt mushrooms vs. salting them (generously) at the beginning produce identical results for me? I don't believe I've debunked a cooking belief held for generations, and I'd like some feedback.

As a side note: [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/when-are-you-actually-supposed-to-salt-mushrooms-article) did an (unscientific) experiment and found that early-salted mushrooms reduced less; basically, salt did the opposite of what people think it does and kept moisture *in* the mushrooms.

Next weekend, I want to have some friends over for a bbq and wanted to do a pulled lamb shoulder since it’s kinda different. Just going to low and slow at 225-250 on my smoker, crutch with foil when it stalls until it hits an interal 203. Rest it for a while and pull it just like pork.

I wanted to do a whole Mediterranean spread and use the pulled lamb for pitas. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of rub to use and also what I might be able to spritz the lamb during the cook to add flavor? Apple Cider Vinegar is what people usually use for pork but I wanted to use something that would showcase Mediterranean flavors.

So far, what I’ve read is saying to just use olive oil, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. But I’m wondering if some rosemary might work too. And would making like an herbed water for the spritz be useful? Like adding oregano, thyme and sage to water and let it sit for a while to flavor it up before spritzing onto the meat. 

Just looking for anything that might help the process. I’ve never really cooked with lamb so I’m not really sure what goes well with it during the cooking process.

I got my first restaurant job at 14, went to the Culinary Institute of America at 18, and have been baking professionally (or writing about it) ever since.

I spent six-odd years writing a cookbook called [*BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts*](https://www.amazon.com/BraveTart-American-Desserts-Stella-Parks/dp/0393239861/?tag=serieats-20), a New York Times bestseller that went on to nab a James Beard Award. You may be more familiar with my pal [Kenji](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/?tag=serieats-20), who wrote the foreword. My book covers the history behind everything from Snickers to Snickerdoodles, with recipes for all that and more.

I approach baking as a craft, so my recipes are all about spending time in the kitchen because it's fun. For me, making a [homemade Klondike bar](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/09/homemade-diy-klondike-bars.html) is as satisfying as eating it, so it's rare that my recipes quick or easy; I don't see baking as a chore to be done with ASAP, but a pleasurable way to explore new ingredients and technique.

No shame if that's not your jam—some people would prefer to get out of the kitchen and on with life, and others would prefer not to get into the kitchen at all. Quick and easy recipes, as well as store bought treats, are there for folks who need them. You'll get no shade from me.

I'll pop by as much as I can today to answer questions about whatever comes up. I love talking about American desserts and baking traditions, technique both classic and modern, as well as equipment and culinary history, and copycat recipes.

741,ckuxgc,Sourdough mysteriously not rising much at all despite (seemingly) good conditions. Help?,"(I asked this over at /r/breadit but that sub seems kinda dead for advice)

The starter was nice and bubbly, to begin with. It had been fed 8 hours earlier and left in a 77F kitchen.  Although it was only about 50% larger than when I fed it, it passed the water float test with flying colours. 

I followed the same recipe I always do:

- 400g flour (this time made up of 200 plain white, 200 strong bread)
- 230g water
- 160g starter
-  5g salt 

I mixed everything together except for the salt, which I added after the rest was incorporated. I then kneaded for around 20-25 minutes, until it passed the window pane test. Then I left it out in that same kitchen, same temperature, for 3 hours. 

When I came back, it was only 30% bigger! I was expecting it to fill up the bowl as it normally did, but it barely looked like it was getting started.

742,ckut0e,Is there a reason lemon juice should thicken a cream sauce? My recipe seems to suggest it should.,"I've been making a chicken recipe that includes a creamy lemon sauce. My question is about the sauce. 

For the sauce, the recipe instructs to cook shallots in butter, add vermouth then reduce before stirring in 1 tsp flour. Then add 75ml double cream and simmer. Then add the juice of half a lemon, at which point the recipe warns the sauce may thicken considerably (and if it's too thick don't worry as you thin it out later with creme fraiche). 

When I make this the sauce doesn't really thicken, or at least no more than you would expect from the flour, and it's only a teaspoon so it's really not much. 

The recipe gives the impression that it's after adding the lemon specifically that the sauce should thicken. Is there any technical reason for this?

765,ckcjeb,How can I make mayonnaise with olive oil without it turning bitter? And also tips on texture/consistency,"I want to make mayonnaise at home with olive oil. I had read that blending olive oil too much would make it turn bitter, so I decided to try making it by hand with a whisk. I followed Samin Nosrat's method from Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. I took a whole egg (yolk and white), warmed to room temperature by running it under warm water, and started beating it. I slowly added 3/4 cup of olive oil by drizzling it in with a small spoon while I whisked.

Partway through I was really tiring out, so I switched to using the whisk attachment on my hand blender. Around halfway through adding the oil, I added a little bit of lime juice, which helped bring it together I think. But then my mother who was helping me added a whole teaspoon of mustard at once, which I think made it break. I was able to bring it back together by using Samin's method of adding half a teaspoon of water to another bowl and slowly adding the broken mayonnaise while whisking. I also added a garlic clove mashed to a paste in a motar and pestle with some salt and lime juice, a little black pepper, and at the end some cilantro.

The end result had the consistency of a thin sauce, so at least it wasn't totally broken. But it had a very greasy mouthfeel. What could I do differently to make it come out lighter and fluffier?

The worst part though was that the olive oil did turn quite bitter with all of the whisking. Is the hand blender too strong even with the whisk attachment? Or maybe I was just taking too long? The whole process took at least 20 minutes; I was afraid of adding oil too quickly.

I'd like to try again, and I definitely want to use olive oil. Does anyone have any advice on how I could do it differently?

I also never measure or weigh anything. Cooking for me is instinctual once I understand the techniques and flavors.

So the questions are:
What are the factors that might cause the cheese to clump together and separate from the butter and pasta water?
If I do mess it up, how do I fix it and bring it back to life? 

The basic recipes I used last time was:
Cook pasta in salty water until just tender.
When that cooks melt butter with a cup of the pasta water. (I probably used 1/4 of a cup of butter.)
Whisk them together until combined and slowly off heat add cheese. (I eye balled 1/2 cup grana padano 24 month old and pecorino cabestrato)

803,cj05mq,Cuisines that don’t use onions/garlic/etc much?,"Hi! I hope this is okay to post here. I read the rules and I recognize this is more of a broad question, but was hoping to get advice from experts who are familiar with and have studied many different cuisines.

I did the FODMAP elimination took diet last year and learned that I am extremely sensitive to anything in the allium family (onions, garlic, leeks, etc). I can tolerate very small, very cooked amounts with only a stomach ache (ex a slice of pizza). However, much more causes severe stomach troubles for days. 

I’m wondering/hoping maybe there are cuisines I’m less familiar with that don’t use much onion/garlic in the first place and will thus be more full-flavored tasting. 

I’ve been getting by with recipes and subbing garlic oil where I can (since the part I’m sensitive to is not fat soluble) or just omitting entirely, but I realize maybe what I need to do is expand my horizons into other cuisines that don’t rely on the allium family, if this even exists. Most of the recipes I currently make are either American, Italian, Scandinavian, or Indian. (My go-to recipe source is Nom Nom Paleo and I just omit what I’m sensitive to, to varying levels of success in terms of taste.) I’ve basically stopped cooking Thai curries, a previous standby, since it’s usually heavily garlic based.

820,cjd69j,Too much yeast? Is it geographic?,"So I'm going to do everyone a favor and keep this short because I tend to be long-winded.  

I'm a fairly accomplished home cook and baker.  I've worked for a Michelin-starred chef in a five star country house in the UK, I've cooked and baked for myself and husband for years.  I am fairly confident that I can follow recipes correctly.  I'm not stupid and I have a full kitchen with scales, measuring cups and measuring spoons.  Through life changes, I have ended up living in central Arkansas, USA with my husband.

We returned home from a visit to my family in the UK a couple of months ago.  As usual, I immediately underwent my usual bread homesickness.  American bread is undeserving of the name and is an abomination.  I decided that this time I was going to do something about it and bought my first bread machine from Amazon (it's just a basic Oster - I'm not sinking $$$$ into one right away.....but it works and does the job it is supposed to).  I am not interested in baking loaves of bread by hand - I need a bread machine to do the work so I can relax on my weekends away from my full time job.

I recently stocked my pantry with all-new ingredients, bread flour, new yeast, etc. etc.  I have baked three 2lb loaves in my bread machine so far.  NONE of them have worked out.  I have followed recipes to the letter.  Upon doing research for my loaves' particular problems, everything is pointing me towards suspecting too much yeast. 

The loaves proof three times in the bread machine throughout a 3hr 25min cycle.  The first two raised so much that they touched the lid and it looked legit like a football in there - then, when the element fired on and it started baking, the top sunk in the middle and left me with a giant crater and no dome after baking fully.

The THIRD loaf I tried, I went back to basics and just tried to get a standard white loaf to work out, and picked a recipe with what I felt was a better yeast-to-flour ratio (1.5tsp of yeast instead of the 2.25tsp that my bread machine's manual was calling for).  During its proofing and rising, it looked very hopeful, and didn't rise anywhere near as much as the previous two.  However, when it came to bake, the same thing happened - although perhaps not on quite such a grand scale.  The top sunk and the loaf was not nice and domed once baked.  What ALSO happened on this third loaf was that the bread DID stay up in the pan a bit more, but only to actually bake AROUND the removal handle for my machine's ingredient pan.  So I had to semi-destroy the (imperfect) top of the baked loaf to even extract it from the machine and cool it. 

So is my problem STILL too much yeast?  I have NEVER had this problem with yeast before - you simply measure and add it to your recipe.  The only difference I can think of is that I am in a different geographic location now than when I used to work as a chef.  I am now living in the subtropics in Arkansas, and after having these issues I have only just learned how much climate can affect things.  Should I cut my yeast to a measly ONE teaspoon for a 2lb loaf of standard bread?

828,cin6po,How can I cook a tomato for BLT to work around a food allergy?,"*To lead off, the allergy type I have is very mild and never life threatening or dangerous. I'm merely trying to avoid an annoyance here while still enjoying a food I love.*

I love farm fresh tomatoes, especially right now at peak tomato season, thinly sliced and layered on some toast with crisp lettuce and bacon.

But I have a fairly common condition called ""Oral Allergy Syndrome"" where many fresh fruits and vegetables cause a mild allergic reaction. That means that if I eat a fresh tomato I get this uncomfortable cottonmouth sensation and a scratchy itch in the back of my throat.

The trick is that this allergy is only for *fresh* produce. Any cooking, even a light pasteurization, breaks down whatever it is I'm allergic to. So I can happily eat tomato sauce, ketchup, or even a hot pasta dish tossed with fresh diced tomatoes. But the straight cold slices of tomato on a BLT I simply can't do.

832,ciykxb,how to keep green lentil curry from turning to brown soup?,"kinda looking for some suggestions i could try ...

i tried for a while now to make a tasty curry with green lentils. however, the lentils tend to lose colour and making the curry itself turn brown. maybe that’s the reason most lentil currys are made with red lentils ... what i’m looking for is al dente lentils that retain their colour but also blend well into the curry

things i’ve tried: soaking lentils in water with baking soda then shortly cooking them in the curry and adding coconut milk at the end, cooking them separately and adding them to the curry for like a minute didn’t help either (not even with the colour) and i don’t enjoy the extra pan lol

https://i.imgur.com/Bs7JwHV.png (excuse the potato, yes it's probably a mortal sin but I had like 20 minutes to cook all this.

So with my limited knowledge of cooking and seasoning, and reading up about it, I decided to season it with just salt and pepper and used olive oil to coat the steak in, not the pan (It still stuck even though at a high heat) I am convinced olive oil is completely useless.

This is the end results https://i.imgur.com/qRAtJi9.jpg

I know it's not the greatest and honestly I had somewhat of an idea on what to do, my only issue is that instead of a nice sear, it is just brownish, there isn't any caramelisation and maybe that has to do with there not being much fat in the steak or its cut, I am not sure but I think I did okay with the cooking portion, I did it at a high heat which is how you obtain good caramelisation no?

Now I am wondering what I ended up with, since a lot of the farmers didn't have the clearest info on what varietals they were offering, and it was busy enough that I didn't want to ask an annoying amount of questions. 

None of them are the standard American globe or Italian types, and I'd love some help figuring out what they are so I can highlight their comparative strengths, and also hear a bit about what those strengths might be? I searched but the top hits all give them different names so I am hoping y'all might have a consensus. At this point need the most guidance on  #2/second from the left....

[Here's a picture of all of em](https://imgur.com/V7LYNJI), but I've described them too in case y'all don't want to click through or images and links are even more against the rules than I realize. From left to right in the linked image:

1: What I think of as Japanese eggplant (almost black they're such a dark purple, slender, mild consistent curve, few seeds). I feel like they're usually richer and creamier than a lot of other types?

2. r/whatisthisplant suggested these were either Sicilian or Kamonasu. About softball sized and both a lighter and more varied purple than the standard globe. Have a more pure white under the stem end than I am used to seeing, which extends down into the flesh of the fruit somewhat

3. These could be graffiti, fairy tale, or something else entirely. Ranging from egg sized to like a stretched out baseball, a medium violet color with white striations

4. These I am pretty sure are Indian eggplant. Basically just look like tiny perfect globe eggplants, about the size of a chicken egg. The internet seems to suggest they should be either stewed whole or stuffed? 

5. I think of these as Chinese eggplant. Long and straightish with a lighter violet hue than #3, in my experience they're really insanely creamy and lightly seeded and should basically always be stirfried.

I’m 22, been cooking 5 years, got married March 2019, wanted to start a family young so I got a little niño on the way. Biggest fear is that in order to be successful on my career path is that I’m going to sacrifice time for family and time for religion in order to meet the demand that my job has.

I’m currently a cook III and I am always looking at how the chefs above me act. They know a shit ton about their station for sure and they seem to always be in the kitchen. Especially Cook I’s who seem to cover every shift that needs filling. For instance our room service Cook I who had to cover overnight, went home at 7am and came back at 2pm for service. That’s insane, sure it doesn’t happen a lot but that guy doesn’t have a life.

My family will always come first in my life and I’ll never regret that, but cooking isn’t just taking your time but your mental thought too.

Solved. If you put a water logged ball of gluten in a hot oven it will make steam and rise.

If you bake it below boiling point to dry it out, and then cook it you will get crusty bits of bread.

I was using a semi-sweet chocolate (equal parts heavy cream and chocolate) for a soft ganache filling and I was using a 60% dark chocolate for the shells. Both of them were real. I heated up 2/3 of the dark chocolate in a bowl over a pot of simmering water with light stirring until it was fluid and could 'cascade' off the side of the spatula when lifted up. After letting that be for a minute, I pulled it and added in my remaining 1/3 of chocolate and stirred vigorously for probably around 3-5 minutes ( it was a very small sample size of chocolate). 

I then did the 'temper check' by sitting a spatula with some chocolate on the edge.. but it never hardened. In fact, it mostly just sat there. I put a knife with some on it in the fridge and it solidified. It kept that satin sheen even when I left it on the counter later. 

What am I doing wrong? What do I need to do to get my shells to solidify at room temperature? I assume that I'm not at full temper, but what other things should I do to achieve this?

Tahdig recipes online tend to go through these steps:

1) wash, soak the basmati for an hour or more.

3) form the tahdig and cook with the remainder of the rice, covered, on high heat for 10 minutes.

4) turn the heat to low and cook/steam while covered for another 40-60 mins.

I did a test run while keeping an eye on the cooking process, and I ended up only needing to boil for 3 minutes and cook on med-high for 2 minutes - at which point I smelled it was burning, and quickly decided to abort mission by throwing in the saffron water I'd made and steaming it on verrrry low for just another 5 minutes.

The rice turned out fluffy and fully cooked, saffron water fully absorbed - but infused with the flavor of burnt rice. The extent of the burning could've been worse, but it did kill the enamel pot.

I don't think ""the heat was too high"" is enough of a reason, as I had it on medium high: 7/8 out of 10 on an induction stovetop.

961,che5j7,Why does the cooking time vary GREATLY when ovenbaking chicken?,"So every night, I marinate a chicken leg &amp; thigh with olive oil, turmeric, ginger and salt. Then I toss it in the oven at the same heat (=,200) above some sliced potatoes and eggplants.

If I leave it all in until the chicken is ready, the potato and eggplants will burn. So I usually have to take the potatoes/eggplants out before the chicken.

My question is, why is the time it takes for it to get ready so inconsistent? Some days, after removing the potatoes/eggplants because they're ready, I have to wait 15 minutes for the chicken to get ready. Sometimes I have to wait 30 minutes, sometimes 45 minutes.

Yesterday it took a total of 40+20+15 minutes until the chicken was ready. Today, it's taken 40+20+55 minutes so far and I'm still waiting on the chicken to get ready.

What determines how long it takes for the chicken to get ready? I use the same spices/olive oil every day and I slice the potatoes/eggplants into equally thick slices every day. And of course I use the same heat in the oven. So why is it so inconsistent? What am I missing?

971,ch3uyd,Make chicken stock in a cast iron dutch oven?,"Tonight I attempted to make chicken stock (or bone broth) with a whole chicken. I roasted the pieces beforehand, but only lightly. There was no obvious deep coloration as a result of the roasting. I threw it all in a cast iron dutch oven and brought it to a boil on the stove top, then simmered for ~6hrs.

At the end, the liquid was incredibly dark. Like — way darker than any other chicken stock or chicken bone broth I've seen. Since nothing in the mix was burned or dark, I'm wondering if it's possible that the cast iron discolored the broth? I strained everything out before jarring with a sieve lined with a cheese cloth. There were definitely some black flecks left on the cheese cloth, but even after straining those out the liquid in the jar is a deep, deep dark brown. Almost black.

The liquid tastes fine (quite good, even), but I'm wondering if I *should* be drinking it, or if I should toss it. Has a boatload of iron leeched into it? Or flecks of the cast iron itself?

Does that differ for zest and juice?",papaganda22,askculinary,When to add lime for best flavor Im just braising some chicken thighs to shred and put on nachos What Im curious about is when to add lime for best flavor And this applied to more than just this dish I love the fresh hit of lime I get when I squeeze a lime on a taco or curry after its served But if I added the lime at the beginning of a braise I think the flavor dulls and its less bright When would you add lime to a longer cook Does that differ for zest and juice,0

990,cgxq7m,Smooth Lodge Cast Iron?,"Was at a brewery/restaurant (Greenbush in Sawyer, MI) and they served food in lodge cast iron.  I've mostly used Carbon Steel at home due to the smoothness of the cooking service.  I know there are high end and antique Cast Iron with polished interiors, but all Lodge pans I've seen in a store have been very rough on the cooking surface.   The waitress didn't know what I was talking about when I asked.  Best guess from [Lodge.com](https://Lodge.com) would be that I saw a Heat Treated 6.5"" skillet, but no where does it suggest these are smoother or polished on the inside.

Anybody wanna have some input? I know that the yogurt will probably be grainy and liquid. I'll be draining it anyways. Will fermenting for a much longer time help with the product?
